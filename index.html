			 <p>Thought on the morning: I think that apps like <strong>Tapestry</strong> and <strong>Reeder</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> are failing at one thing: a single timeline where content converge is enough. It isn&rsquo;t. I came to realize that the world is complex and requires many angles of content consumption. Another problem is the diversity in feed velocity. If one feed takes over the timeline, it&rsquo;s crash the whole thing. Until they add multi-timelines and find a way to moderate high-volume feeds, I&rsquo;ll refrain from adding these apps into my daily routine.</p>

He shared an article today on <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2025/01/27/micro-social-your-timeline.html">his blog</a> where he talks about the timeline feature. That&rsquo;s cool. What is even cooler is that I decided to support him with a $1 a month subscription via his &ldquo;<a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/gregmorris">Buy me a coffee</a>&rdquo; page.

			 <p>We are solely responsible for the concentration of power in the hands of a few large tech companies. As individuals, we granted all that power to these megacorporations, which, at one point, were not yet large corporations. Thinking otherwise is ludicrous. Laws are a band-aid, we, the individual by our own choices must take back that power. We need to undo the last 15 years to some degree of equilibrium.</p>

			 <p>I had a conversation with a friend yesterday about our respective hobbies as content creators. He’s quite into YouTube, while I’m more into writing. At one point, we discussed the importance of being transparent with our employers about our hobbies. Since we share our content publicly, we should consider informing our HR department, at least according to him. I’m not entirely convinced about this, though. Nobody really knows about what I&rsquo;m doing online with my blogs and YouTube channel. According to my friend, it might be a positive thing that my HR department is aware of what I&rsquo;m doing because this puts me in a different class of employee, even my boss should know.</p>
<p>I’m still contemplating whether this is a requirement or not. After all, my hobbies don’t negatively affect my job, so why should I discuss my personal pursuits when I’m not working?</p>

			 <p>So I launched <strong>my personal website in French</strong> yesterday by writing a very short post on my Facebook account. Many people visited the blog for sure, and got one message via Messenger from a guy that I barely know. A few of my closest friends wrote to me, those I selected to a get a peek before the &ldquo;official&rdquo; launch. It&rsquo;s fun to connect without all the usual noise.</p>
<p>On a different note, I spend 2 minutes looking at my Facebook timeline and boy this is junk. I don&rsquo;t understand why people are still paying attention to Facebook. What a cancer.</p>

			 <p>Idea of the day for <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> : what if people could submit a blog post for inclusion in the Discovery section? Users could be allowed to submit one per week or per month. The &ldquo;moderator&rdquo; could then decide to release it or not. If not, it could provide a reason to the original poster. Just an idea.</p>

			 <p>Today, I think I finally found a real use case for <strong>Micro.one</strong>. I bought my domain and set up my account. It was rather quick and easy. If I had let Micro.one set up my domain name for me, it would have been even easier.</p>
<p>I think the ingredients of Micro.one are all there for an accessible solution for those who want to get out of Meta or other silos and start owning their little space on the web, free of tracking, free of ads, and built on open software technologies. Of course, Micro.one isn’t the only service of its kind. But it does offer the right feature set to be an open and federated web citizen.</p>
<p>I feel an overwhelming desire to explore and savor this type of web content even further. I believe that sharing my passion for this subject matter could potentially ignite a similar level of enthusiasm in those around me. Even if it doesn’t, if people are genuinely curious enough to inquire about the reasons behind my enthusiasm, it’s a positive development, potentially marking the beginning of something more substantial. After all, who knows what the future holds?</p>
<p>I’ll share more in the near future.</p>

We don&rsquo;t know how these revenues are calculated, but it is a bit insulting or at least discouraging. At this rate, I won&rsquo;t recover the Partner Program subscription cost in the first year which makes my presence there questionable. This should have been a no-cost journey which it&rsquo;s not.

			 <p>While working on the next edition of <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/tag/ephemeral-scrapbook/">the Ephemeral Scrapbook newsletter</a>, I wanted to proofread and rewrite some text portions. I first started with <strong>Apple Intelligence Writing Tools</strong> then pasted the results into Craft. <strong>Grammarly</strong> instantly took the ball and verified the pasted text, highlighting everything wrong that needed some attention. Is Apple Writing Tools sloppy or Grammarly too picky? Writing in English is not an easy thing for me to do. And it&rsquo;s not easy for generative AI either, apparently. From what I understand, Grammarly tries to be less wordy and is very iterative in its text proofing execution.</p>

<p>Here is the final tweaked version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1️⃣ First and foremost, I want to extend my warmest wishes for a prosperous and fulfilling new year. I genuinely hope you find success and happiness in your professional and personal endeavors. 2️⃣ Secondly, this marks the inaugural edition of this newsletter for 2025, and I’ve decided to introduce a few changes. Firstly, I’ve decided to eliminate the summary at the beginning of each newsletter. This section provided an overview of the number of blog posts, photos, and other content I’ve shared since the previous edition. While I appreciate the interest in these statistics, I believe it’s unnecessary to brag about them, and it takes a significant amount of time to maintain and update this information. I’ve also officially decided to retire the podcasts section from my newsletter. While I enjoy podcasts, I don’t find them particularly relevant to my current content creation schedule, and I believe it’s not worth dedicating time and resources to them.</p>

			 <p>My brief testing of posting images to <strong>Pixelfed</strong> from <strong>Micro.blog</strong> is positive (<a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2025/01/05/a-somewhat-old-photo-of.html">image1</a>, <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2025/01/05/two-years-ago-in-buenos.html">image2</a>). My blog visual theme (Tiny Cards) supports image posts without being too fancy. The only thing is the lack of image collection selection when posting from Micro.blog. This has to be done after posting. Might come later, if we call @manton attention! Posting from Micro.blog app is similar to Pixelfed app. The nice thing is that Micro.blog automatically generate an image description, something that is done manually with Pixelfed.</p>
<p>For 2025, I&rsquo;ll use this workflow and see how it goes. I created a new image collection for the occasion: Travel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I’ll go one step further Nelson, I have a growing hatred towards pointless images in blog posts in general, I don’t even care if they’re AI-generated or not. If they’re there as part of the content then by all means use them but if you’re just adding a stock image from unsplash to make the page “feel” more interesting then you’re just part of the broader problem that’s plaguing the web.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Header images</strong> do add to the page load times, yes I do use AI-generated images from time to time, like in <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/a-year-in-review-apples-2024-triumphs-and-challenges/">this post</a> where I wanted to make a point, and I use many of my personal photos&hellip; like in <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/the-ephemeral-scrapbook-edition-2024-48/">this edition</a> of the <strong>Ephemeral Scrapbook</strong> newsletter. Yes, I prefer header images on <a href="https://numericcitizen.me">that specific blog</a> because it is part of its visual theme. So then what? That&rsquo;s MY corner of the web. I do what I find cool and creative and whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing he&rsquo;s reading none of my blogs because of this, <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2024/12/24/meta-blog-post-manu-i.html">among other reasons</a>?</p>

			 <p>I’ve played a bit with my wife’s iPhone 16 Pro Camera Control. I think it is cool but not practical. It is the best case of feature or functions overloading on a single control. I think it’s hard to compete against discrete on-screen camera controls because these are much quicker to invoke and the error rate is low. I don’t see the Camera Control to live for a long time as I can’t see a single way of improving it and fixing this usability issue.</p>

<p>Update #1: Sorry to look offensive to some of my readers. I should have been more precautious when sharing such a thought. I was referring to some people, a minority, who invoke symptoms of ADHD without the condition so they can be more easily excused of certain things. Those people exist and their attitude is causing prejudice to people who actually have some degree of ADHD.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;be been trying to build a small business around Craft using Gumroad in the last 18 months. So far, it&rsquo;s a hit or miss. I&rsquo;m currently having paying 20 subscribers for <a href="https://thecraftbible.com">The Craft Bible</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I sold quite a few Craft templates, too. I have many more ideas for 2025 to continue to grow this offering. Yet, it won&rsquo;t replace my day job.</p>
<p>I like Gumroad as a selling platform but also for writing articles and sharing them with my customers. This is not something that I planned on doing when I started, but I must admit that it&rsquo;s fun to build a small community around an app like Craft, away from the public scrutiny of Reddit and Slack. Today, I shared a long op-ed article on my feelings about Craft. It&rsquo;s a long piece that I took quite some time to write. I&rsquo;m quite happy with the results. I can&rsquo;t wait for user reactions and feedback.</p>

			 <p>When writing, I start in <strong>Craft</strong> and then export to <strong>Ulysses</strong> for final review and online posting. It works great, but I’m not always satisfied with Ulysses, which sometimes feels overwhelming. Enter <strong>iA Writer</strong>, an app that I remember using in its early days and that I liked for its simplicity. <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/2024/12/12/authorship-and-the.html">This blog post</a> from Greg Morris reminds me of the perpetual questioning of my decision to settle on Ulysses.</p>
<p>This morning, I decided to download a trial of iA Writer. The first thing I checked was which publishing platforms it supports. To my surprise, it supports all the ones I depend on: Ghost, Micro.blog, and, to a lesser extent, Medium.</p>
<p>This blog post was written on my 15-inch M2 MacBook Air using iA Writer trial edition. Sadly, iA Writer couldn’t post as draft, so I had to manually copy and paste the content into a blank post on Micro.blog.</p>
<p>My Ulysses subscription ends on March 25th, 2025, but this publishing bug is a deal-breaker for now. Back to Ulysses.</p>

			 <p>My brother-in-law got a M4 Mac mini recently. The last time he used a Mac was with the Macintosh LC III, more than thirty years ago. One thing he still struggles with, then and now: the menu bar that changes when switching apps. The other thing: he doesn&rsquo;t get the Stage Manager. He turned that off.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My experience with <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong>’s <strong>Writing Tools</strong> is mixed. One significant issue is the absence of a feature to compare the original text with the revised version. In contrast, Grammarly excels in this regard, as its suggestions are contextual. Additionally, the constant need to select text to “feed” the Writing Tools becomes tedious. Another challenge arises when using Writing Tools with markdown content or links. These get mangled in the revised version. Finally, speed is also an issue. Even for simple text to process, it can take quite some time to get a response.</p>
<p>For now, Grammarly remains my preferred writing assistant, and I have no intention of switching to Apple Intelligence’s Writing Tools anytime soon.</p>

			 <p>Here is a thought about recent tweaks to RSS importer on Micro.blog. For example, now it&rsquo;s possible to import photos in the RSS feed published by Glass. With this, when I publish a photo on Glass, it gets posted on my blog too. The same photo on two platforms. As much as I like the POSSE principle for writing, it doesn&rsquo;t fit well with my desire to share photos on special places, like a photo-dedicated service. Glass is such a special place, just like Pixelfed. What would be the point of having a single photo spread out on other platforms? I see places like Glass like museums. Pieces of art hanged on the wall of a museum are unique to this place. It makes the place unique. I&rsquo;m still thinking about all this.</p>

From the buyer’s profile and posts I can infer the following: he believes in conspiracies, he is an anti-vaccine, he is a proud pro-Trump, and the icing on the cake: he is pro-Russian. 🤮</p>

Once the migration from the old Mac mini is complete, I&rsquo;ll be using a two-display setup. My Synology NAS was moved to a separate table to make some room for the LG display.

But now, with Omnivore&rsquo;s future and slow demise, I&rsquo;m getting fed up with those one-man-shop open-source projects.

			 <p>For those using macOS 15.1 and have enabled <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong>, have you noticed a spike in your Mac CPU usage when requesting Apple Intelligence to proofread text? The longer the text, the more pronounced the spike. The CPU will reach 100% for a moment before slightly decreasing before receiving a response. Interestingly, I couldn’t identify an AI-related process associated with this spike. Instead, the kernel_task process is the one who consumes the CPU cycles. Apparently, Apple Intelligence runs in the kernel space.</p>

Is Apple Passwords the perfect solution? No, but it’s more than adequate for my needs.

			 <p>I visited the Apple West 14th Street Apple Store this past weekend in New York City. As usual, the store was packed with people. However, one thing caught my attention: there was no one at the Apple Vision Pro tables. Despite being at the peak of their support, those devices felt quite lonely and unappealing. How long will Apple keep those devices for sale?</p>

Anger, ennui, boredom are just a few things that I&rsquo;m noticing more and more.

			 <p>If I were in charge of IT infrastructure at Apple, I would be more than happy to have a phased deployment of <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong>. This staged deployment mode allows for better control over resource allocation, performance tweaking based on demand. It is the right time to establish the baseline metrics that will help further larger-scale deployment later in the deployment schedule. People find that Apple is behind, but I say it is more of a realistic approach that makes a lot of sense from a user experience perspective.</p>

			 <p>I returned to <strong>Medium</strong> with enthusiasm but was disappointed by the clickbaity titles that we can find. For example, I read an article titled &ldquo;iPhone 16 Pro Max Unveils New Features That Left Me Stunned!&rdquo; only to discover that the author was excited about a potential new photo mode with the telephoto lens (macrophotography) without citing sources for the rumors. The author speculated on the revolutionary nature of the device without testing it. It raises questions about the possible involvement of generative AI in crafting this story. Oh, and the other article: &ldquo;Why I Stopped Upgrading to the New iPhone Every Year (And You Should Too)&rdquo;&hellip; I can&rsquo;t wait to let someone tell me what to do. 👀🤷🏻</p>
<p>Compare this to <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/the-m4-mac-mini-will-be-my-best-mac-ever/">my latest post</a> about the M4 Mac mini: &ldquo;The M4 Mac mini Will Be My Best Mac Ever&rdquo;. I speak for myself only in the title.</p>

I also had this symptom of missing out on things from my old colleagues and friends just by glancing at my timeline for a few minutes. It felt heavy. My post was about telling my &ldquo;Facebook friends&rdquo; about the two sites where I share my photos online: <a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">Glass</a> and <a href="https://pixelfed.social/i/web/profile/583629418009617054">Pixelfed</a>. I don&rsquo;t know if people will take time off their busy lives to visit or even bookmark the sites. I shouldn&rsquo;t care about that. Those who pay attention might even notice a link to <a href="https://hub.numericcitizen.me">my digital hub</a>, where I share all my other sites. Because I&rsquo;m curious, I&rsquo;ll return back to Facebook in a few days to see if I got some comments. I&rsquo;ll report back here in any case.</p>

			 <p>I always found this picture of <strong>Steve Jobs in his home office</strong> very fascinating. It&rsquo;s too bad that we cannot read all the book titles. But there are two pieces of equipment that I wonder what they are. On is something that looks like a Mac Pro but the size of the computer is too small, even though Steve is using a big Apple display (30&quot;?). Next to this is a bigger vertical device which would be a UPS, but also looks like an external GPU (but that wasn&rsquo;t a thing at that time).  Oh and in the left segment of the bookshelf, there are many small bottles of liquid drops. What were they for?</p>

<p>People are frustrated with Apple&rsquo;s behavior regarding the App Store, leading them to make exaggerated claims. While one may disagree with Apple&rsquo;s policies, stating that the company is simply relaxing is an overreaction.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/">Rumors</a> suggest a &ldquo;finally&rdquo; moment, with Apple on the verge of completing the redesign of the newest generation of the Mac mini, this time featuring an M4 chip. This could result in the smallest Mac ever.</p>
<p>The current Mac mini design dates back to 2010, when Apple was still using more power-hungry and larger Intel chips. The only change over the years has been the back portion to accommodate a variety of port offerings. When Apple transitioned to Apple Silicon chips, right after the Apple Silicon Dev Kit was made available, I expected a redesign and saw the Dev Kit as a transitional step, simply because the chip is smaller, more power-efficient, and requires much less cooling. To me, this was the right time to do so. However, they did not.</p>
<p>If you look inside an M1 Mac mini, thanks to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac+Mini+M2+Teardown/157365">this teardown guide</a> from iFixit you can see that there is some empty space. Coupled with what Apple can do with the M4 iPad Pro, and the environmental pressure to be more efficient in resource consumption (power, materials, etc.), it is clear that the Mac mini must be rethought from the ground up. Will Apple go with an external PSU for this? I don&rsquo;t expect this to be the case.</p>
<p>One more thing: I&rsquo;ve been a satisfied user of the M1 Mac mini since 2020, but I&rsquo;m increasingly considering an upgrade, either to the Mac Studio or a more powerful Mac mini. I&rsquo;ll be sure to pay close attention to my options.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people like me do want a Mac for getting all of our stuff done, but Apple doesn&rsquo;t make exactly the Mac we want, so we lust after the iPad and lament how it doesn&rsquo;t get the job done for us. If the Mac we wanted existed, we&rsquo;d buy that and not have nearly as much to say about iPadOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Matt is nailing it. Apple doesn&rsquo;t want to make an iPad run macOS, fine, but are they as much vocal against making a Mac touch-friendly? I don&rsquo;t think so. Mike Gurman wrote this past week-end that one Mac will see a major redesign in the next 12 months. Could this be to introduce touch support?</p>

<p>Apple used to sell a plastic ‌iPhone‌ 5c, for example, and it came in vibrant blue, yellow, pink, and green colors.

<p>I wonder if Apple could use 3D printing for the SE plastic case. There are rumors that Apple might use 3D printing in building devices. That could be it.</p>

			 <p>I always enjoy MKBHD&rsquo;s videos, and <a href="https://youtu.be/vJEbP2Vdq2U?si=NAXVJHPh9g_NBR8Q">this one</a> about the <strong>Microsoft Surface ARM laptop</strong> is no exception. His views are well-balanced and feel honest. Now, about this specific lap, supposedly being fast with long battery life, great built quality and&hellip; a touch screen, certainly feels like a leap beyond Apple&rsquo;s offerings, but&hellip; it&rsquo;s running Windows. And that, is the problem. I wouldn&rsquo;t buy one of these for the simple reason that running Windows required running a bunch of security-related software to keep it secure. How much processing power these apps takes out of the base configuration? Certainly a few percentage points, but for me, it&rsquo;s ruining the whole thing. And that, MKBHD don&rsquo;t mention anything about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eddy Cue doesn’t lose many arguments but he lost that one. All of the effort spent pushing Apple to support RCS would have been better spent pushing Apple to ship iMessage for Android. And without a supported iMessage client for Android, that role ought to go to WhatsApp, not RCS. WhatsApp is free, secure, and works equally well on all phones.</p>

Filtering keywords include: Amazon, Deal, Rebate, Gift, Discount, Prime, Amazon. You get the idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s decision to strike a deal with Taboola is shocking and off-brand — so much so that I have started to question the company’s long-term commitment to good customer experience, including its commitment to privacy. As it chases more and more revenue to appease Wall Street, it’s clear Apple will become one of those companies that prioritize shareholders over paying customers and their experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hate ads. I hate ads. This is a sad day. <strong>That is not cool at all.</strong> How can Apple brags about protecting user privacy (see <a href="https://youtu.be/0HjDpPnxcP0?si=80JumzViX1KAKzTT">that ad</a> on YouTube?) and al while serving ads through an external ads network? More than ever, Apple is becoming like everyone else and IS profiling its users, for money. I&rsquo;m starting to hate Tim Cook&rsquo;s Apple. As soon as I see a change in News, I&rsquo;ll cancel my subscription to Apple One.</p>

			 <p>There is something incomplete in how <a href="https://youtu.be/0HjDpPnxcP0?si=80JumzViX1KAKzTT">Apple is portraying Safari</a> as a way to stay private when surfing the web. The ad is certainly visually striking, with surveillance cameras flying over people as they browse the web on their non-iPhone devices. It&rsquo;s a compelling analogy. It reminds me of another Apple ad where a person is in a similar situation, being watched and followed by a group of people who want to know their online whereabouts.</p>
<p>But you know, Apple is mum about its deal with Google as being the default search engine in Safari. The last time I checked, Google isn&rsquo;t the type of privacy-protection company you might think they are.</p>

			 <p>Manuel Moreale <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/@/page/G9tElWdhQ3j8wIDG">reflecting</a> on one hundred people who took the time to sign his guestbook (I did):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s the number of people who have taken a few minutes out of their busy lives to write something on my guestbook. One hundred doesn’t seem a lot in the grand scheme of things, especially on the web. If you have one hundred followers you might as well have zero. One hundred views on a YouTube video? That’s nothing. You need at least one hundred thousand to be part of the conversation. And yet, I find one hundred signatures in a guestbook to be a lot. <strong>Can you imagine having one hundred people in front of you, all saying something to you, one after the other? It would feel overwhelming.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often think about this. Just like Manuel, I have a blog, a YouTube channel, a podcast (sort of). Globally, my follower counts are very low (even lower than Manuel&rsquo;s) when looked through the Internet scale lens, but if those people were in front of me, in the same room, that would be quite something else. I find this thought to be comforting.</p>

<p>But speaking of the DMA, Chromium is, far and away, the most popular browser engine that the DMA compels Apple to allow on iOS. There are legitimate reasons to wish that Apple allowed third-party browser engines on iOS. But there are also legitimate reasons why Apple doesn’t allow them. Chrome really is bad. Better to let the market decide than let clueless regulators decide.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the side of Gruber here. Governments are usually not very good at tech. We should always be on the doubters side when they want to regulate. Opening up the iPhone will make it weaker than today, not better. I would even argue that the vast majority of users will lose more than they gain. But some techies will be happy.</p>

We strolled through the streets of Split once again and had breakfast at the &ldquo;Bepa&rdquo; restaurant, which is accessible from one of the public squares. Once again, we ate very well. However, the prices for food are even higher than we expected. We&rsquo;re coming to the conclusion that traveling in Croatia is almost as expensive as traveling in countries like Italy!</p>
<p>Today also marks the beginning of a short cruise that will allow us to visit the islands of Korčula and Mljet before arriving in Dubrovnik, our last stop before returning to Canada.

			 <p>Once again, with a bit of delay, I’m sharing a new update on my trip to Croatia. Yesterday, the day was primarily spent on the waters in front of the city of Split. We took a small speedboat cruise to visit three beautiful large islands. The tour lasted more than ten hours. We also passed through the popular Blue Lagoon and visited a cave located on the island of Bisevo, where the turquoise water offers a surreal setting. It was absolutely magnificent. We had a mini lunch in Hvar and spent two lovely hours there, strolling and enjoying this beautiful place. A fishing village welcomed us. Fishing is still practiced there, but tourism is by far the largest economic activity. The architecture of the buildings is similar to what is found throughout the Croatian coast, with light stone buildings and terracotta-tiled roofs in shades of orange. This is also similar to what you find in Italy, by the way. We had a quite bumpy return to the coast as the sea was much more agitated than in early morning. It was quite an experience. Thankfully, the boat operator was experimented.</p>
<p>Regarding food, restaurant offerings mostly consist of grilled dishes, mainly fish and meat. Tuna salads, Niçoise, and Greek salads are also on the menu. Some restaurants feature typical Croatian dishes like goulashes. The sale of ice cream and gelato is very common in southern villages, where it&rsquo;s warmer. I succumbed a few times, actually. The brightness on clear days here is absolutely perfect, just like everywhere on the Côte d&rsquo;Azur.</p>
<p>We are halfway through our stay in this beautiful country. Tomorrow, we will embark on a small cruise for a few days to visit other islands, ultimately leading us to our final destination: Dubrovnik, where we will spend a few days. I’m really looking forward to it.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I didn&rsquo;t have time to write the daily update because it was a transition day by car to our next destination: Split in Croatia. Of course, we took advantage of our route to stop in Trogir to visit and have lunch there. It was our last stop by car as we had to leave it at the airport in the suburbs of Trogir. From now on, we will take a boat. More details to come on that.</p>
<p>Our journey continued to Split, taking a taxi via Uber. The trip took a little over half an hour. Once there, we went to drop off our luggage at our apartment and took some time to explore the surroundings. What a strange but beautiful urban environment. Our apartment is located inside the old palace of Split. Accessing it is not easy as there are winding corridors and numerous stairs to climb. We felt like we were living within the walls of a medina like those found in Morocco. It’s lovely.</p>
<p>I took advantage of the late afternoon light to take some photos. What a beautiful city. I already know that I won&rsquo;t have enough time to see everything and try to capture photos that are off the beaten path. I&rsquo;ll do my best, and it will serve as an excuse to wish to return someday.</p>

			 <p>Once again, what a beautiful day we had in Sibenik. The main objective today was to visit the three forts of the city, which offer a splendid view of the town and the islands off the coast. The weather was magnificent even though storm cells were threatening the region. Fortunately, we were spared from rain and lightning!</p>
<p>We visited the three forts, which were overall interesting but are mainly worth visiting for the views they offer. We took advantage of the occasion to have a picnic at lunchtime while the wind was blowing moderately across the area. It was pleasant to hear the wind rustling through the trees, mostly mature pines.</p>
<p>After visiting the forts, we descended back into the city, this time making sure to choose a parking spot on the west side of town so we could walk along the long promenade by the docks. We ended up in the old part of the city to revisit and complete our tour from yesterday, which was merely a preview. This time, I had the good camera in hand, and I took the opportunity to capture new perspectives different from those taken yesterday.</p>
<p>We were back at the apartment around 6:30 PM to freshen up before heading out to a small neighboring village of Vodice, i.e., Tribunj. I can&rsquo;t wait to see this little village.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to share some of my best pictures.</p>

			 <p>As you probably know, I’ve been writing and sharing my travel notes since the beginning of my trip to Croatia. I’m proud of maintaining the regularity to post each day, but not as proud of my writing itself. I can’t quite describe the quality of my writing, but when I read it back, it feels rather superficial. Why do I feel this way?</p>
<p>Well, my writing tends to list the places I visited and whether I liked them. But I almost always fail to explain why I loved visiting them. Take yesterday’s travel update, for example: I wrote that I fell in love with Sibenik and shared a photo of banners adorned with children’s drawings. What exactly resonated with me in this place? What were my emotions when I entered the narrow streets of the village and first saw the banners everywhere? It was surprising—the children’s drawings added a contrast to the old buildings&rsquo; walls, giving the city a sense of humanity. And you know what? It was the children’s festival! It’s a great way to celebrate humanity.</p>
<p>Part of my problem is that I’m not a native English speaker, but a French speaker. I don’t have the same level of vocabulary to describe feelings or physical places. I’m wondering if I could first write a version of my travel update in French and then ask ChatGPT to translate it into English. For today’s travel update, that’s what I’m going to do. We’ll see how it comes out this time. Let me know if you notice a difference.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: this text was first written in English (yes, in English!) and I asked ChatGPT to improve to the writing. It made a big difference, trust me, but I still have this feeling of owning the ideas and the final results.</p>

			 <p>It’s been a day with ups  and downs. We left the apartment at around 10:30 AM in direction of the Krka National Park, 45-minute drive to see some other waterfalls and translucide lakes. The first part of the visit was really nice because it was like a repeat of the other visit to the national park that we visited earlier in the week with great waterfalls and gorgeous lakes with transparent blue water. Unlike the first national park, this time, it was much more crowded to a point of being unpleasant at some point because we had to wait for people to finish their selfies. 🤨</p>
<p>We left to see another part of the park where a bigger waterfall was expected and was located further in the park, but we couldn’t locate it and wasted our time waiting for the bus to get us back to the parking lot. The last stop was to visit a secluded church rather hard to locate on the maps. We eventually ended up at the entrance and couldn’t buy any tickets to visit the area but a priest did let us anyway visit the monastery and the areas with a little smile on his face. It was a welcomed gesture.</p>
<p>Next up, we had to return to the apartment to exchange my pair of glasses otherwise I would have been enable to drive at night when coming back to the apartment. For dinner, we decided to go to Sibenik, a great little village near Vodice. Oh boy I instantly fell in love with it. I didn’t have my main camera so I was left with my iPhone to take as many pictures as I could. We decided to come back tomorrow and this time, I’ll bring my other big camera. I can’t wait for this.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here’s today’s travel update. What a wonderful day we had, thanks to this day-cruise around the Kornati Islands, starting from Vodice’s port at 9 AM. We had lunch at around 11:30 AM, right before a 3-hour stop at one of the island (can’t remember the name!) where we could spend some time swimming at the beach or in a very salty small interior lake. I decided to go for the trail around the lake instead, a 2.2KM quick trekking. While the temperature at the village was expected to reach 33C during the day, weather on the sea was cooler and very nice, with very little wind, except in the trail where the temperature probably reached more than 30C with partially shaded trail sections, thanks to tall pine trees. A bit scary discovery: while walking the trail in the forest, I encountered many big spider nets at about fifteen feet high each with a gigantic spider standing right in the middle, waiting for the next prey. It was a bit scary and disgusting, not my favourite thing to see. Overall, it was a great day.</p>
<p>I took my telephoto lens with me this time around and it was a judicious decision. I started editing my travel photos and I must say that without Adobe Lightroom’s built in catalog, it’s a bit cumbersome. I often get this error in Photomator as seen below. It’s a bit frustrating. I think it’s more of an iPadOS instabilities than a problem with Photomator.</p>

			 <p>M. G. Siegler <a href="https://spyglass.org/apples-vision/">musing</a> about possible next iteration of the Apple Vision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most compelling idea would be allowing/forcing the &lsquo;Vision&rsquo; to tether to an iPhone or Mac to run the computing of the device. Frankly, I think they should do this. I know they view it as a stand-alone computing device, one that could potentially do it all one day, but that day is far, far away. You already have to use the ridiculous (and ridiculously inconvenient) external battery to power the device. They should either put a Mac SoC in that brick or use their software screen-casting smarts to offload much of the work to an iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that people know they have to live with an external battery pack in order to use the Vision Pro, putting a small Mac-in-that-box to offload some of the weight off the Vision Pro could be a game changer too. Apple is clever at iterating on things to make them better. The Apple Vision is not done yet, just be patient.</p>
<p>In other notes: the Vision Pro is coming to Canada this July and I can’t wait to book myself a 30-minute demonstration appointment.</p>

			 <p>We didn’t do much today: taking our time early in the morning when preparing and having breakfast and then spending time on the beach and relaxing. I did some writing too, from my iPhone while sitting on my sunbathing chair. It’s far from being ideal for writing longer posts but it is what it is. I had some thoughts to share about AI, generative AI more specifically (like this <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2024/06/29/maybe-we-should.html">thought</a>, <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2024/06/29/could-generative-ai.html">this one</a> and <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2024/06/29/pressure-might-be.html">that one</a>).</p>
<p>We came back to the apartment after having a drink at a beach club nearby. Then, again, we were quietly spending time online before getting ready to prepare the meal for dinner. Our plans for the rest of the day is to return in the village’s center to feel the village’s night life. It’s only a ten-minute walk from where we stay. It’s very convenient.</p>

<p>Also: generative AI content used to train generative AI models is also source of concerns to me. I call that process “knowledge desinfection” or  “knowledge toxification” or even better “knowledge asphyxiation”. Or should I replace “knowledge” with “intelligence”?</p>

<p>In a way, we’ve all been trained ourselves in our life by the books we read, the movies we saw, the music we listened.

Some people might be trained on a specific music style or dancing style. We’ve been trained by teachers. As “trained” creators, do we ask a permission when writing something new or writing music using our training data?

			 <p>Today we left for Zadar and Vodice where we will stay for five days in a small apartment. We arrived at noon in Zadar and had a nice picnic in a small park, under the shade of big trees. It was a quiet place and we wondered about how few tourists seem to be present since we arrived in Croatia. It might not be peak season just yet. We spent nearly three hours in Zadar, a great coastal city of Croatia, to walk in the city’s small streets behind the fortified perimeter. It felt a bit hot even for a coastal city, yet the weather was splendid. We saw (and heard) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_organ">sea organ</a> and we were pleased by the sound of it.</p>
<p>We left Zadar for Vodice at 3PM, a one-hour drive on a coastal road. As we drove away from Zadar we saw the surroundings slowly change in appearance. Vodice is a small village where we can find great places to have dinner and visit the marina surrounded by typical summer houses and beach clubs. Tomorrow I should have more to say about this small village.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this morning, the weather was better than yesterday, so we decided to revisit Plitvicka Jezera National Park. The improved lighting allowed us to better appreciate the lake’s renowned blue and green hues, and there were fewer tourists. However, we didn’t stay as long as our previous visit because we wanted to explore a small village called Rastoke. This village, known for its charming houses and numerous waterfalls, was highly recommended by our host. We enjoyed a picnic there before exploring, and we were not disappointed; the place was delightful.</p>
<p>On our way back, we stopped to see the river’s source near the road. To our surprise, we found several old, barely standing buildings, which made for great photography. However, a thunderstorm was forming nearby, forcing us to cut our visit short. After checking the local radar, we realized we had just enough time to escape and return to our car.</p>
<p>And we were back at our B&amp;B at four fifty. It’s another great day in Croatia. Now loading up a new batch of photos into my iPad.</p>

			 <p>We left Zagreb today to go visit the Plitvicka Jezera national park. it was a two hour drive from Zagreb. After a nice and smooth ride we arrived at around 11:15 AM in the park ready to tackle the 4-6 hour circuit. Boy this place is wonderful! It took us about four hours. We had a rain shower or two but each time we were lucky to be at the right place either on the boat or in the forest so we didn’t get wet! Lucky me because I wasn’t ready for rain with my unprotected photo equipment. Speaking of photography, I don’t know how many shots I did but I’m pretty sure there are a few quite impressive with such natural surroundings. I can’t wait to process those images.</p>
<p>Tonight, we’re going to have dinner at a house near our B&amp;B in Grabovac, a very small village be close to the national park. They served grilled fish and meat. It supposed to be really good. We’ll see, but I trust the Croatians so far!</p>

			 <p>We went for another walking session in Zagreb after the rain finally went on pause in the second half of the afternoon. We visited another portion of the city before ending up near the restaurant where we planned to have dinner, a Sri Lanka restaurant called “Curry Bowl” which again was rated five stars. It was absolutely delicious. But just before going for the dinner we stopped at a little bar because the rain started again. It was “apéro time”. All in all we enjoyed Zagreb: a nice, relativelyely quiet European city where we always felt in safe.</p>
<p>Tomorrow heading off to Plitvice Lakes National Park for two days. It will be quite a different environment.</p>

			 <p>I’m currently writing this from our room as there are some heavy showers outside. We had a chance to walk a lot since morning in Zagreb and had a great lunch at the restaurant called “Heritage” which is close to our B&amp;B. It’s a very small place where only maybe ten people can have lunch at the same timee (counting those 3 tables outside!). They make absolutely great sandwiches with Croatian ingredients (ham, truffle spread, local cheese, etc.). We also all a great walnuts salad and a drink. Eating is our great pleasure when visiting a place like Zagreb. This place has five stars and is not that expansive.</p>
<p>Back to our room, I’m writing this post after I imported my first batch of images (62 in all) and started to tag which one I would process. All this is done on my iPad, Files and Photomator. Works great so far. The only thing is that I forgot to change the time zone so my pictures got the wrong time stamp. Not that big of a deal. If the internet speed was better, I would have included an image to this post, but that’s not the case. Too bad.</p>

			 <p>First full day in Croatia. It is the morning here in Zagreb. Yesterday, we arrived and spent the first few hours wandering in the city center where all the night life is happening. It was the time to spot the places that we were to revisit later (today). We were tired following our two flights by night.</p>
<p>There was a soccer match at 9PM and people were quite excited and were looking forward to it. It ended end up in a tie 1-1 Croatia against Italia. I don’t care too much about soccer but Croatian do quite a lot!</p>
<p>I didn’t take my camera with me as I felt my iPhone would be enough. It was a good call anyway because it was rather late in the evening. We had dinner at a restaurant and had goulash and beer. It was a typical plate for Croatian apparently. We came back to the B&amp;B exhausted by our air travelling. I do feel the jet lag this morning but I expect thing to improve in the next two to three days.</p>
<p>This blog post was a writing exercise to practice my daily journaling while traveling abroad.</p>

But that&rsquo;s for quite different reasons. When iOS 18 ships, we won&rsquo;t get <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong> either, unless we set our phone to English US, which I won&rsquo;t do, except for testing the thing for a few moments.

<p>Update: sadly, images aren&rsquo;t exported while exporting in Markdown format. Not surprising, but it&rsquo;s a nearly a dealbreaker.</p>

He wasn&rsquo;t sure why he was getting that many requests. After calling the IT department for support, he was baffled by the responses he got for his problem: reboot your phone, uninstall Apple Mail and re-install, that type of shitty responses. After a few tries, he finally got the &ldquo;real&rdquo; reasons: iPhone aren&rsquo;t supported officially and weakening the security posture of the whole company, he should get an Android. What a shitload of bullshit, which is often typical from IT guys who don&rsquo;t understand or know Apple devices. I&rsquo;m so tired of this, after all those decades.</p>
<p>Back to my call with my CEO, after trying to understand the situation and find a sound explanation, I told him that the type of answers he got was unacceptable. We are an IT company for god&rsquo;s sake! He was shy of admitting the same and surprised by this nonsense. He is the CEO, a smart guy. We should do better.</p>

			 <p>In a week, I&rsquo;ll be preparing to fly to Croatia for a three-week vacation with my wife. I&rsquo;m still considering several aspects of the trip. How much blogging should I do during this time? Should I stay quiet and focus entirely on my vacation and photography? What camera equipment should I bring? Should I bring my MacBook Air in addition to my iPad Pro?</p>
<p>I need to decide the right balance between being present in the moment and documenting the journey through my blog. While I enjoy sharing my experiences, I also want to fully immerse myself in the trip without the constant pressure of content creation. As for the camera gear, I&rsquo;ll need to carefully assess what I&rsquo;ll actually use versus what I might pack just in case. The MacBook Air could be helpful for editing photos on the go, but the iPad Pro is a more compact and convenient option. Ultimately, I want to travel light and focus on making the most of this vacation with my wife.</p>
<p>I still have a week to figure this out.</p>

			 <p>Apple announced a significant development at this year&rsquo;s WWDC: the creation of its own cloud infrastructure named &ldquo;<strong>Private Cloud Compute</strong>&rdquo; for securely handling certain <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong> requests. As an IT professional working in data center technologies, I have a few questions that remain unanswered even after watching John Gruber&rsquo;s The Talk Show Live:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What CPU is used in each server? I wonder if Apple is utilizing high-end versions of its Apple Silicon chips. It&rsquo;s worth noting that there was no update to the Mac Studio this year. Is Apple diverting M3 Max or M3 Ultra production to build its Private Cloud Compute data centers (which currently feature 32 Neural Engine cores in the M2 Ultra)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of case design is Apple using for the servers? Are they modified versions of the Mac mini, or are they using a rack-mount variant of the Mac Studio?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Apple deploying data centers only in the United States or across multiple continents? I suspect the latter, for the sake of redundancy and capacity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I expect that sometime in the future, perhaps at WWDC 2025, Apple may reveal details about the first year of Apple Intelligence in a short video. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>

			 <p><strong>Using templates in office</strong> work can sometimes be counterproductive, leading to less original thinking, reduced engagement, and fewer creative problem-solving opportunities. Templates can make it easy to fall into a routine of just filling in blanks, resulting in more generic outputs and a checkbox mentality. This reliance on templates can also make it challenging to adapt and innovate when a task doesn&rsquo;t fit the template. To keep creativity and innovation alive, it&rsquo;s helpful to use templates as a starting point while encouraging team members to think critically and adapt as needed.</p>
<p>Some of my colleagues are highly dependant on them, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m staying away from them. It&rsquo;s a creative thinking killer.</p>

Swiping up to unlock the device momentarily covers the camera and sensors, disrupting the process.

Yet, I find this cool because this is going to be available also to my podcast subscribers. Because of that, I call this an audiocast since the textual transcription (the writing) is done before the audio recording. Audiocast: this word doesn’t exist, isn’t it?

			 <p>Mac computers are fast and have impressive battery life. Mac Studio with the M4 Ultra ship can wait. The iPad is fast too, potentially surpassing the performance of many Mac computers. It is thin also. Really thin. We get it. The iPhone is fast, light, thin and features excellent camera capabilities. Enough of incremental updates. That is why I do not want new Apple hardware at the upcoming WWDC conference, even if it was a home router, a la AirPort.</p>
<p>Instead, I think Apple&rsquo;s software in general requires attention and improvement.</p>
<p>For instance, the iPadOS user interface could benefit from refinements to enhance the overall user experience. Similarly, the macOS notifications center and the iPhone Control Center may need rethinking to improve their functionality and usability. Additionally, the macOS Settings app could undergo further enhancements to provide users with a more streamlined and intuitive interface. These are examples of user-facing interfaces that could benefit from further enhancements to better meet the needs and expectations of Apple&rsquo;s customers. Oh, and Siri needs even more works to become the real intelligent assistant we are all waiting for. That&rsquo;s the story I wish for WWDC this year.</p>
<p>No new hardware, please. Thanks you.</p>

			 <p>The upcoming <strong>Windows 11 AI &lsquo;Recall&rsquo; feature</strong>, which is designed to take regular screenshots of a user&rsquo;s PC content to help them find past information, has been called a security disaster by a security researcher. According to the expert, Kevin Beaumont, the Recall feature is essentially an &ldquo;infostealer&rdquo; that can be exploited by hackers to access sensitive data, such as user interactions, text messages, passwords, and websites visited. Despite Microsoft&rsquo;s attempts to improve the security of Recall, the researcher claims the feature will &ldquo;set cybersecurity back a decade by empowering cybercriminals&rdquo; as the underlying database can be accessed through malware-infected PCs.</p>

This suggests the company is focusing on enhancing the user experience when interacting with <strong>AI-generated responses</strong> to user requests.

			 <p>Hi everyone. I might be late to the party, but I finally sat down for a few minutes to test Micro.blog&rsquo;s new feature: narrated blog posts. It is strange because this is my first use and I cannot write a full review because as I&rsquo;m writing this, my audio recording is still not done, and I don&rsquo;t know how is the audio attachment and processing will actually work. It might be similar to when I post a new podcast episode. In any case, I think this is a clever addition to an already useful and enjoyable blogging service. Thanks to <a href="https://micro.blog/Manton">@Manton</a> for this. Now, should I say, &ldquo;have a great day and see you for another blog post?&rdquo; Probably not.</p>
<p>[Update #1]: It seems the play button doesn&rsquo;t show up. Probably a bug with the Cards theme. Investigation started.
[Update #2]: I found out that narrated blog posts come out as podcast episodes on Podcasts. I&rsquo;m not sure this is what I want.</p>

Everything works fine until the iPad starts acting up and disable the external display. It’s like if the cable was being disconnected and reconnected every few seconds. A restart of the iPad fixes the issue for a little while. Very frustrating to say the least. Probably a bug with iPadOS 17.5.

			 <p>After spending half an hour in the Apple Store comparing iPads with and without the nano-texture display, I came to the conclusion to skip the nano-texture display and here are the reasons why:</p>

<p>The display doesn’t provide a paper-like sensation when using the Apple Pencil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a subtle difference in image sharpness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The blacks are less complete blacks, which cancels the OLED screen advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contrast seems to be a little bit lower on the nano-texture display.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The corollary of this decision is:</p>
<p>a) I’m saving some money.</p>
<p>b) Since I’m settling on the 512GB of storage, I’ll get only 8GB of system memory.</p>
<p>c) This iPad is a little bit less future-proof.</p>
<p>So, that’s it for the decision about this display finish!</p>

			 <p>Finally got the new <strong>iPad Pro</strong>: 11-inch, 512GB of storage, which means &ldquo;only&rdquo; 8GB of system RAM and no nano-texture display. I made the decision after spending 45 minutes testing the new iPad. The nano-texture display is super nice to the touch, but it does reduce image crispiness. With the Apple Pencil, that texture doesn&rsquo;t really reproduce a paper-like feeling. That, I could add that later with <a href="https://paperlike.com/">Paperlike for iPad</a> when it becomes available. Plus, I saved a lot of money. There is a limit to what I can and wish to spend on Apple hardware. 🤷🏻‍♂️ More details, like a mini-review, soon.</p>

One last thing: <strong>Siri</strong> looks like a prehistoric bot. Apple has to do something about this, and fast.</p>

			 <p>To those who reviewed the <strong>new iPads</strong> and concluded that the hardware is great but iPadOS is the limiting factor: it is becoming tiring. The iPad is not and probably will never be a Mac. If you wanted utter flexibility, it&rsquo;s the Mac. Why is it so hard? Can you just move on to something else? Thanks.</p>

But what is currently happening right now in IT world with the Broadcom merger with VMware is absolutely criminal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Broadcom is doing some massive cleanup in the VMware house and the the list of SKU who was completely replaced with new bundles and licensing mode. For many big organisations (governmental for example), subscriptions price are simply going sky high. Many government agencies are now facing something like 3 to 10 times what they used to pay for about the same features set. It is criminal and if anything, this is something that should be looked into with more scrutiny. It is one thing that a bank is paying much more for something, but when it comes to government services, it is tax payers money. That&rsquo;s quite different. We have to call it out publicly.</p>
<p>I wish we would talk about this more in the general press, not only in the tech field.</p>

			 <p>From what I&rsquo;m reading and seeing, the <strong>AI Pin</strong> and <strong>Rabbit R1</strong> are terrible devices for potentially great AI use cases, while the <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong> is a technology marvel device with weak use cases. The former are probably DOA because they risk lacking funding to keep the show going, while Apple&rsquo;s massive resources might save the Apple Vision Pro from a complete failure.</p>

			 <p>This morning, my wife picked up her iPhone and tried to unlock it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. She couldn&rsquo;t after a few try<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. She tried a few times with a slight variation, but the iPhone refused to unlock itself, now showing a 15-minute delay on the lock screen. Her passcode is a complex one as per corporate security rules. She knows it by heart, she told me. She doesn&rsquo;t know what to do, and she is in deep doubt now. Eventually, she asked me for help, but I told her I cannot do much about it<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was the infamous Apple ID being locked out, but it&rsquo;s not the case. As a reminder: the passcode used to unlock your iPhone has little to do with your Apple ID. But, when using 2FA, the iPhone is required to get access to the Apple ID and must be unlocked for this to work. Maybe this is why people think they are both linked together. It&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>As I finish writing this up, my wife tried again to unlock her iPhone and it worked. All is good now. But it&rsquo;s a reminder that, for most people, security is hard. It&rsquo;s hard to experience. It&rsquo;s hard to explain. It&rsquo;s hard to get over it.</p>

			 <p><strong>Microsoft 365</strong> or Office 365, if you prefer, is so overrated. Microsoft is the master of selling licenses but when it comes down to doing real serious collaborative work with Teams and the rest of the software suite it falls apart really quickly. For example: trying to collaborated on a Word document, creating comments and assigning a task toi someone&hellip; nobody knows really where the task is actually saved! And no one seems to get a notification&hellip; or nobody cares to look at the activity tab in Teams because it is so overwhelming! Oh and don&rsquo;t get me started with Microsoft Loop, a pale copycat of Notion. And should we talk about Visio? I prefer not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so fed up of working in an IT field where everyone is short sighted with Microsoft. I mean, there are so much more powerful collaborative apps out there.</p>

But what is cooler is that people will be able to reply to my articles right from here on Micro.blog and get their reply published right under my articles, just like on Micro.blog. I think this is a good way to offer a reduced friction experience compared to having to log in to post a reply, which is the standard way to interact with a Ghost blog post.

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been discussing a lot about <strong>design</strong> in general with my wife recently regarding our home improvement project. Design is hard. The process of redesigning a 3D space (a room, a bathroom) is not trivial but I think we should always try to start from a minimalistic concept from which we can build on step by step later. Also, not everyone has the same ability to visualize something in 3D without first seeing it for real, even with 3D computer assisted design. It will be a long journey.</p>

After applying a suggestion, it will iterate and suggest something else that it could have figured out in the first place. They are transitioning to AI, and I think it will help. Oh, and Grammarly considers markdown formatting marks to be corrected.</li>
<li>Yesterday, after watching <a href="https://youtu.be/MndzBJfw7dI?si=ZaDvcJLYUZB7JNXL">this video</a>, I wondered if I should switch to <strong>FinalCut Pro</strong> for my video production. There are things that I find super cool and useful in FCP that I don’t have in <strong>Screenflow</strong> like <a href="https://www.gling.ai/">Gling.ai</a>.</li>
<li>It took me 22 minutes to write this post.</li>
<li>Maybe I could alternate between Scribbles and Micro.blog for this /Now post. What do you think? Don’t miss <a href="https://blips.numericcitizen.me/categories/now">previous /Now posts</a> on Scribbles.</li>
<li>This is a photo that I processed yesterday night. A better version will soon be available on <a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">my Glass page</a>, though.</li>

<p>It’s easier for me to do this using Scribbles editor. I don’t know why. Might be a combination of how the compose screen is styled and laid out, plus the use of a WYSIWYG editor. But whatever it is, it all combines into an experience where the words flow a little easier for me. That’s probably the only way I can describe it. There’s nothing really empirical about it all, but maybe that’s the point. It’s involves the emotional side of writing: the “look and feel”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I prefer Scribbles editor to Micro.blog&rsquo;s, too. There is something about Scribbles that makes the experience more enjoyable. But I&rsquo;m still using Micro.blog for longer posts and Scribbles for short ones, except maybe the /Now posts. Well, it&rsquo;s complicated. Anyhow, I think Micro.blog&rsquo;s post editor needs some more love.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m unsure if I&rsquo;m getting too old, but topics like <strong>DOJ vs Apple</strong> and everything preceding it are too complex for me to dive into. It may be a vital part of Apple&rsquo;s current history, but I struggle to grasp it. I appreciate the efforts of non-professional tech pundits and Apple enthusiasts who delve deep into this and share their perspectives tirelessly. I&rsquo;m not reading all the comments and takes on this, again because there as way too many. I do understand too that the course of the iPhone experience might see an inflection point in the coming years, if what is currently happening in the EU is any indication. I think it&rsquo;s sad because the bases for this aren&rsquo;t forming a consensus; something probably unachievable.</p>
<p>This all explain my indecision about who&rsquo;s right, who&rsquo;s wrong. I don&rsquo;t trust governments&rsquo; capabilities in understanding our tech world, that&rsquo;s for sure, which means I&rsquo;m not optimistic about the future of this particular case. Apple is big. So is Google. Facebook. And the like. They are the fruit of the &ldquo;American way&rdquo;. I guess that at some point, we prefer mediocrity in the name of &ldquo;open markets&rdquo; and to give an &ldquo;equal&rdquo; chance to all who wold like to compete.</p>

			 <p>Today, I came across a blog via someone&rsquo;s else blogroll, and to my surprise, while browsing the blog&rsquo;s content, I couldn&rsquo;t find a single post with a publication date. So, let me be clear: I&rsquo;m not feeling at ease when visiting a blog that don&rsquo;t display publication date for each post. I can of understand the idea of  &ldquo;timeless&rdquo; content, but I feel at lost with the author&rsquo;s decision. I need time references in my digital life so I can better understand the content and the context. Call me old school if you want. I&rsquo;m ok with this.</p>

			 <p>Just completed a one hour customer presentation this morning. It was the culmination of a six-week project that shoud lead to bigger opportunities. I love doing presentations and I’m really comfortable doing so in front of people, especially when it is directly related to my field of expertise.</p>
<p>Each time I prepare such presentations, I always think about Steve Jobs keynotes. Always. He was a model for me. And still is. There is a little bit of his way into my presentation delivery: setting the stage, telling a story, and a « one more thing » whenever possible.</p>

			 <p><strong>Apple</strong> seems to be on a streak of really questionable decisions regarding the <strong>App Store</strong> and the <strong>developer&rsquo;s community</strong> in general that will take years for them before they can say: oh gosh, we fucked up.

			 <p><strong>Craft on iPhone</strong> is so much different than on the iPad. It feels like a totally different app. If I were an iPhone-only user I wouldn’t buy a Craft subscription because the iPhone version is so bad. Thankfully the iPad version is much more workable and the Mac version is probably the best Catalyst-based app out there. It wasn’t always like that btw. Was much better before version 2.7. I don’t know when that situation will change.</p>

			 <p>I find those stories always fascinating when I read about a blogger moving from one platform to another. It is as if every hosting solution cannot have it all. There is always too much friction, or something is simply lacking, which prompts us, content creators, to drop one service and search for something else. One service can have a great visual design<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>yet lacking from the analytics side. One platform can be well-designed but very hard to keep up and running<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Another solution that can be dead simple to publish lacks visual design flexibility<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Can we have it all? I sense a business opportunity here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m permanently questioning my current options. Right now, I’m fine with my hosting solutions, but one never knows when something no longer fits my needs.</p>

			 <p>Still not clear if it will only rain or if we will get heavy and abundant snow. Weather forecast is predicting only rain. I&rsquo;m ok with this. This winter has been so warm so far, that&rsquo;s incredible. We will probably be in a drought this summer because of the lack of snow this winter. And you know what it means? Forest fires.</p>

			 <p>Some authors on the internet are against using their content without permission to train the models behind generative AI. As a blogger, this question often comes to my mind. On one hand, I believe that training without permission poses an ethical issue. I am unsure if we have genuinely addressed this question as a society. On the other hand, I question the danger of many authors wanting to silence their voices by blocking the training process to access their online content. Now more than ever, I feel that all voices are essential in ensuring that model training reflects our diversity as much as possible. I don’t want bots and haters to win the race. We, as authors, need to offer resistance. I’m not sure how this challenge will be solved, if ever.</p>

There should be a way to turn off a shortcut so it doesn&rsquo;t appear in places like share sheets. I wish Apple spent more time on Shortcuts than they do on Swift Playground.

It&rsquo;s certain that a &ldquo;remarkable&rdquo; tablet offers very limited functionality compared to an iPad, but it raises the following question: Should Apple consider going back to creating single-purpose devices? For example, the iPhone killed the iPod, but I think if Apple re-entered the market with a new line of <strong>iPods</strong>, it would be very popular.

			 <p>Yesterday, while writing and editing a report for one of our clients, I used <strong>ChatGPT</strong> for two different use cases. One use case was to ask for a summarization of what &ldquo;firmware&rdquo; is and how critical it is. The second use case is to define the pillars of a data management and governance policy in the enterprise. On that one, I asked for more details about managing unstructured data. The ChatGPT results were mind-blowing. I know a lot about this specific IT field, and I could validate the correctness of the answers. I saved a lot of time because of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>But what about my ethics?</p>
<p>Should I write a disclaimer in this report that says GenAI was used to put together some portions of this report? Is the client ready and mature enough to read this disclaimer? Will he understand that ChatGPT is in fact like an assistant to whom I asked to summarize what a data governance policy is? How do I cite my sources?</p>

I&rsquo;m reading that the AI portion of the project will be folded into the other AI team(s) within Apple. It&rsquo;s good because Apple needs all it can get in AI to stay relevant in that field and imagine the future beyond Siri.</p>

			 <p>💡 Today, I want to share the newest addition to <a href="https://hub.numericcitizen.me">my digital publishing space</a>: <a href="https://meta.numericcitizen.me">my metablog</a>, hosted on Micro.blog. This isn&rsquo;t entirely new; another version is already in place, but it is hosted as a series of Craft-shared documents. What I&rsquo;m sharing today is hosted on Micro.blog using the recently introduced increase in the number of blogs you can have with a single premium account<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. From this migration, my metablog will gain RSS feed support, enable POSSE, and be closer to my online community here on Micro.blog, but also on Mastodon and Bluesky.</p>
<p>One last thing: this is a work-in-progress, a build-in-public thing. I&rsquo;m slowly transposing most of my content to this new home, one post at a time. You&rsquo;ll know it because of cross-posting and the <a href="https://meta.numericcitizen.me/rss">RSS feed</a> provided that you subscribe. 👈🏻 Some posts date back to 2020, but you might be surprised by discovering a few gems.</p>

			 <p><strong>Thought of the day</strong>: Micro.blog is probably the most fun and flexible thing on the open web these days that I can play with. It is approachable which in itself is a great quality. It is a creativity “unleasher”. When something is fun, I want more of it. I want to spread the word and share my excitement. 👊🏻</p>

It’s mostly complete, so this week’s edition partially follows the “build in public” movement. I wonder if I should start sharing the document at the beginning of the process so that you can see the whole creation process as I’m working on the current edition. What do you think?</p>
<p>I’ve been doing these summaries since last September and enjoy putting them together. It’s issue number 22. Enjoy. The email version is coming out later today.</p>

			 <p>Well, after much testing, and with a bit of sadness, the best way for me to <strong>migrate</strong> from a <strong>Craft</strong>-hosted website to a <strong>Micro.blog</strong>-hosted website will be to export each document to Ulysses then publish to Micro.blog while back-dating each post. The good side is that I&rsquo;m going to update and rework most of the content. Not all posts might make the cut, though. I&rsquo;ll continue using Craft-hosting solution for the best and richest content visualization.</p>

			 <p>We let Putin&rsquo;s regime <strong>invade Ukraine</strong> in 2014, and we did nothing. In 2022, Ukraine and the world, to a certain degree, paid the price of our inaction by letting <strong>Putin&rsquo;s criminals</strong> do it again, but on a much larger scale. Today marks a sad anniversary and reminds us how costly our hesitation in providing what Ukraine really needs to make a dent in this conflict. I feel sorry for the Ukrainians, and I feel frustrated by our slow and timid reactions. I know that we, the West, did spend quite a lot to help, but we need to do much more than that to kick out those criminals and to make the Russian regime think again the next time they envision invading a free country.</p>
<p>Finally, the prospect of the Trump return as a president makes the future look even darker. The United States influence in the political and diplomatic space around the world looks to be diminishing like the snow under the sun. Trump won&rsquo;t reverse this trend. Who&rsquo;s taking over?</p>

Many of them didn&rsquo;t learn anything because they already experimented with these tools. For others, they learned quite a bit and I saw their enchantment in their eyes. This reminds of 1993 when I gave a similar presentation about tools like <strong>Netscape</strong>, <strong>Newsgroups</strong>, <strong>Gopher</strong>, and <strong>Mail</strong> and how to use http requests.

<p>After Evans Hankey left, Apple eliminated the Product Design Chief role and restructured the product design team under operations chief Jeff Williams. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, some of the people on the design team are unhappy with being led by an operations person instead of a designer, and cost cutting efforts have also changed the way the design team operates.</p>

			 <p>I have been a happy user of Apple Safari for the last decade. If possible, I prefer using Apple’s browser, thanks to its privacy protection and features. If something doesn’t work in Safari, I will try Firefox. I’ll do everything possible to skip Google Chrome. I use Microsoft Edge because of its integration with Microsoft 365 at work. But Safari is never too far, just in case. It’s now my fall-back plan. Why this change? Because of the Arc Browser, which is now my main browser.</p>
<p>I’m the type of user who always tries to find a use case for an app that I really like, even if it is superseded with a better one. I love Craft. I always use it in my creative hobbies, but I found a great use case for Notion at work. I like Apple Reminder for family-related tasks but use Things 3 for my creative hobbies. I like Apple Calendar for my personal life but prefer Fantastical for the office. I keep both. I like HEY mail but must use Outlook at the office.</p>

			 <p>When I look at the <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong>, I see a device with many software and hardware technologies that Apple took years to create, develop and refine. They did it in plain sight with the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac. Each of these devices played a significant role as a test bed for what would come next, a portion of what we can find in the Vision Pro. I can see many examples: windows management introduced on the iPad via the Stage Manager paved the way for window management on the Vision Pro, Three-dimensional and object placement in an augmented reality view in the Apple Store app when placing a virtual Mac on a physical desk, LiDAR Scanner with FaceID paved the way to Personas, continuity on all Apple OSes, and so much more set the playground for a robust ecosystem that takes all its meaning in the Vision Pro. And there are probably hundreds of more technologies that I cannot see. I guess the Apple Vision Pro was in development for a decade at Apple, and with each new feature Apple put into their devices, the headset benefitted from it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering about this upcoming Micro.blog &ldquo;big new feature&rdquo; quite often. What new feature could require its own section on the left sidebar? What could mandate the release of companion apps on iOS and Android? Let&rsquo;s try to think about it for a minute.</p>
<p>So, MB already covers text (as blog posts), more generic content (as pages), photos, books, newsletters, and podcasts. What’s missing here? Videos? Movies? Something else? Could Podcast be more explicitly exposed where the Transcript section becomes Podcast? Is MB building its own podcasting player app? Or a podcast recorder? Can AI play a role in this new feature?</p>
<p>But what else is missing from Micro.blog? Instant messaging? I own a Wavelength group of Micro.blog users. The group is currently hosting 50 users. Here’s the <a href="https://wavelength.app/invite/K8vZnQI51dy#M3iTwlw1LzkPjaBFp8UZGw--">invite link</a>. Near real-time interactions are something I wish Micro.blog had for supporting discussions about specific events<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Frankly, <strong>instant messaging</strong> is probably the closest thing I can think of that would require a dedicated section and a dedicated set of apps on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Your thoughts? Please join in! 🙏🏻</p>

With <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong> arriving in the user&rsquo;s hands, this creates a lot of buzz, and I don&rsquo;t want to miss anything (reviews, videos, etc.). These <strong>reviews</strong> are more interesting than Apple&rsquo;s controller media briefings, which are held in highly controlled environments. And, I have many YouTube videos in preparation, as well as my usual stuff. 😅👨🏻‍💻</p>

			 <p>I just lost 20 minutes of my life trying to figure out how to log back into a <strong>Slack</strong> community with the original email that I used initially. It&rsquo;s probably the most frustrating experience I ever experienced. Slack is unique in that respect, and I just don&rsquo;t get why it didn&rsquo;t evolve over time. I ended up creating a new account, which made me lose all my past conversations. 🙄</p>

			 <p>The work to <strong>switch my blog&rsquo;s visual theme</strong> is going really well. It&rsquo;s a bit easier than I thought to set the desired colour theme, thanks to the plugin&rsquo;s settings and user-friendliness. I may try the switch tonight, so buckle up during the transition. <strong>Reminder</strong>: I&rsquo;ll switch from TinyTheme to Cards Theme. Why? Here&rsquo;s why: 1) the overall design gives some bit of depth to the content. 2) Post categories are exposed and provide an easy way to browse the blog content. 3) The theme plugin settings give some flexibility. 4) Long posts with a title look better. 🛠️</p>

			 <p>I decided to update the look of this blog by <strong>switching to the Cards theme</strong> by <a href="https://github.com/ericgregorich/micro-blog-cards-theme">@ericgregorich</a>. I think this theme looks cleaner and offers more possibilities than the current one by <a href="https://micro.blog/Mtt">@Mtt</a>. Here are a few highlights: better control of colours via the plugin settings web interface instead of editing CSS, support for reading time for longer posts with a title, display of post categories at the top, and more flexibility for displaying the post&rsquo;s date &amp; time, just to name a few. But I&rsquo;m not ready to make the switch just yet because it requires a lot of fine-tuning to get the colours right. I also need to check for compatibility with all my current plugins and ask for a few fixes on the theme&rsquo;s GitHub page. It&rsquo;s another tweaking project on my plate. 😅</p>

			 <p>Numerous applications and services now incorporate AI features. For instance, consider Notion Q&amp;A or Raycast AI. Companies view this as an opportunity to boost revenue by offering these additional features for a fee. However, I recently pondered the possibility that if Apple integrates generative AI into Siri, as rumored for iOS 18, they may not charge for it. This could give Apple a significant advantage, as the revenue from iPhone sales could cover the associated costs. This could become an enormous advantage for Apple.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like paying a fine to an organized crime group. Utterly shocking that the West still helps this criminal government in its war efforts in Ukraine. I can&rsquo;t wait to see Trump licking their butt when he&rsquo;s back.</p>

			 <p>The notion of &ldquo;avoiding vendors lock-in&rdquo; in information technology is interesting. I would argue that it&rsquo;s impossible to completely be without some sort of vendor lock-in<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. At some point, there is always a required commitment level. You commit to open-source software. You commit to a cloud vendor. You commit to a platform. I often give the example of a company building an application internally with a team of developers. In that scenario, the company is committing to something: the application, the data tied to it and its operational model. Applications are hard to replace in many environments. When you decide to invest in software development, you commit to the end product for many years, if not decades, until the organization decides it&rsquo;s time to transform the application into something else<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.

			 <p>I just realized that I could (and should) use <strong>Raycast AI</strong> to summarize articles saved into <strong>Omnivore</strong> and save the summary into the article notes. Then, I could finish up the metadata with appropriate tags. I used to do that within <strong>Craft</strong> before, but the Craft AI assistant uses GPT 3.5, limits the length of the input into the summarize request and doesn&rsquo;t support &ldquo;real tags&rdquo; like in Omnivore.</p>

It&rsquo;s fun to move things around on the internet, but I pay the price for being too impulsive and not intentional in some of my decisions. It was an impulsive decision to subscribe to Write.as. There was something seductive in the post editor, and being open source is the way to go. But I have to admit that it was a diversion. Now, focusing on Micro.blog. 😊</p>
<p>Sidenote: I find great satisfaction in simplification. This reminds me of when I was an indie iOS developer: I remember the instants of removing lines of code and making things leaner. It procured a lot of satisfaction.</p>

			 <p><strong>Microsoft Office apps</strong> for the <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong>? Really? Color me surprised. I&rsquo;m not convinced by the typical productivity use case for the Apple Vision Pro. Judging from what I see, working with things (windows, palettes, etc.) suspended in space doesn&rsquo;t feel natural. What does it bring that the desktop doesn&rsquo;t provide? Visualization use cases, sure, though. Being able to manipulate 3D models is a big yes. Is working with a flat spreadsheet in 3D space great? What does it fix that the desktop couldn&rsquo;t? Maybe the convenience of having the flat spreadsheet besides the 3D model is the right use case. I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my head around this.</p>

			 <p>9to5Mac reporting about WhatsApp usage in the US:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that more people in the US have been using WhatsApp recently is definitely intriguing.  Source: <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/16/whatsapp-more-users-in-the-us/">WhatsApp has been getting more attention in the US</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>iMessage usage in Canada is probably similar to that in the US. I started using WhatsApp when I went to Morocco last summer. I also have a friend who moved from Canada to Mexico, and he switched to WhatsApp, so now I have to use WhatsApp to reach him. I must say that I like it. I also follow some news channels, just for fun. I like the messaging app format to get news; that&rsquo;s why I also use Telegram for the same purpose: to follow news from Ukraine.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s another reason to be sad this morning. 😔 Over the past two years, I&rsquo;ve invested much of my time and effort in building my digital space and presence in <strong><a href="https://www.craft.do">Craft</a></strong>. I spend numerous hours posting things and answering questions in the user community. I&rsquo;ve become a Craft enthusiast or ambassador. One day, someone even asked me if I was working for Craft. I&rsquo;m not. I don&rsquo;t want to be paid. But what I want is a better collaboration with the team over there. I&rsquo;d like to create videos about new releases that would be shared simultaneously as they come out. I&rsquo;ve asked them, and they didn&rsquo;t accept my offer. I&rsquo;ve built <a href="https://numericcitizen.gumroad.com/l/the-craft-bible-v2">The Craft Bible</a>. I&rsquo;ve created <a href="https://craft-feature-request-board.canny.io">The Craft Feature Request Board</a>. I&rsquo;ve created content that best exemplifies Craft use cases. I get no real support from the Craft team. They fail to take advantage of me being this sort of Craft ambassador, and they could &ldquo;use me&rdquo; to help spread the Craft message out there<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I don&rsquo;t understand why they pass over this opportunity. Capacities, a direct competitor to Craft, is doing the opposite. They have <a href="https://bento.me/pkmbeth">this woman</a> who creates tutorials and other types of content and gets referenced in the Capacities release notes! That&rsquo;s cool and useful for the community. But not Craft. Is this a corporate culture issue? Maybe. I just don&rsquo;t get it. It&rsquo;s frustrating. Maybe I should let it go and move on.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant this morning.</p>

			 <p>Made a tweak to this blog: using the Footer field of the Design section (on a Micro.blog feature), I added a footer to each individual post that adds links to my other websites and my Mastodon handle.

			 <p>This morning, at work, I had the idea of creating a <strong>GPT</strong> that would act as a virtual resume for me. Colleagues would prompt this GPT about my professional journey with usual questions about my past experience, projects, certifications, abilities, etc. I uploaded a few files, including my resume and some other professional stuff, to try it out. It took me 15 minutes to create this virtual representation of myself. Tested many prompts against it. I&rsquo;m blown away. The future is here, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

			 <p>Google announcement regarding egress fees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting today, Google Cloud customers who wish to stop using Google Cloud and migrate their data to another cloud provider and/or on premises, can take advantage of free network data transfer to migrate their data out of Google Cloud. This applies to all customers globally. Source: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/eliminating-data-transfer-fees-when-migrating-off-google-cloud">Eliminating data transfer fees when migrating off Google Cloud | Google Cloud Blog</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is major. I often see clients forget to consider the exit costs of any hyper-scaler in the TCO calculation. Getting into the cloud isn&rsquo;t cheap. And up until today, getting out of the cloud wasn&rsquo;t either. Now, for those on GCP, it is. I expect the others (looking at you, AWS, and Azure) to follow, maybe not this year, but they will, either by their choice or they will be forced. This is an anti-competitive measure to charge for egress fees.</p>

<p>Following the publication of “<a href="https://notes.maique.eu/post/what-if-gcerz5xq">What If</a>” by <a href="https://micro.blog/maique">Maique</a>, an avid blogger on Micro.blog, his post prompted me to write my own. But before, here&rsquo;s a summary of his post (thanks ChatGPT):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Micro.blog has been hosting <a href="maique.eu"><em>maique.eu</em></a> for years, but there have been some technical issues. Despite some annoyances, the community and features make it worth the cost. However, there are also cons such as lack of proper notifications and support. Moving away would be a hassle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do share most of his views on the current state of Micro.blog because I did experience some issues with the service myself. I won’t repeat it here. That being said, I love Micro.blog, and I certainly want it to thrive. I’m a believer. I’m a supporter of the ideas behind the service. I subscribe to the premium tier. I love it so much that I created a <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/videos">series of videos</a> about Micro.blog so that others can take full advantage of its features set. But I want to do more. In fact, I can do more. How can I help? Where do I enlist?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/celebrating-reflecting-on-my-30-years-career-in-it/">an IT guy for more than 30 years</a>, I know how hard it can be to run such a service. I don’t know the technologies behind it, but Micro.blog seems to need constant nurturing. Sadly, I cannot help here. I&rsquo;m not a full-stack developer in any way.</p>
<p>But there this <a href="https://help.micro.blog">help.micro.blog</a> support site. I did tech support in the past. I do pay a visit from time to time to gather the mood and the subjects that people care enough to submit posts. Maybe I could help there? I don&rsquo;t know. Could I do a first screening of the posts and direct level-2 requests to Manton for further investigation? He would be freed somewhat from glancing at all the incoming requests and focus on the hardest ones. I don&rsquo;t know. Oh, and this feature requests topic contains more than a hundred of them. I could create a real Micro.blog feature requests board, like <a href="https://craft-feature-request-board.canny.io">this one</a> I built from scratch for Craft?</p>
<p>Then, there is <a href="https://micro.blog/discover">this Discover</a> section: I do pay a visit from time to time. I&rsquo;m not sure how it is being maintained or how often. Can I help there? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What else? I could do podcasting, too! Maybe I could help Jean to revive the highly respected <a href="https://monday.micro.blog/">Micro Monday podcast</a>! I have <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thoughts-and-tribulations-of-a-compulsive-creator/id1703770016">my own podcast</a>; I’m not too bad because I have eight listeners, according to Podcasts Connect!</p>
<p>As you can probably see, I have many ideas. I’m creative. I do have some time to spare for my passions. Micro.blog is one of them. But, as much as I want to help, it means nothing if the doors are closed. I’m not saying that I received a “no thank you” from Manton or Jean. I didn’t ask, actually. Now, I’m officially asking: <strong>how can I help</strong>?</p>

I had a friend who was playing with me. He still does. Apparently, he is so advanced that there is only one explanation: he has a serious addiction. Personally, I stopped playing because it was too time-consuming. I wish I could update my articles because the game evolved quite a bit with new features. But, no, I don&rsquo;t have that time at my disposal.</p>

Watching a 20-minute video to learn about a product indicates many things: Apple is nervous, and the product has a novel approach requiring potential customers&rsquo; education or training so that they fully &ldquo;get the experience&rdquo; before deciding to put the money on the table. Also, I guess someone willing to pay the high price merits some special attention, too.</p>

			 <p>As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/">reported</a> by MacRumors, Apple will have 80K <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong> available on day one. Now, how many scheduled demos can Apple provide to customers in the first ten days of the availability of the Apple Vision Pro? Let&rsquo;s try to find out. 243 Apple Store will have the headset. Let&rsquo;s say there are 6 six guys in the store dedicated to supervising scheduled demonstrations. Could be more, could be less and might vary from store to store. Let&rsquo;s say each demo takes 15 minutes, which allows for 4 demos per hour per supervisor. Let&rsquo;s set at 8 hours per day of demonstration availability per store. Could be more. Could be less. This translates to 192 Apple Vision Pro demo slots available per store. If we think about the first 10 days of availability, Apple could potentially deliver more than 466K demos.</p>

			 <p>Introspection time: I chose to be in IT because I thought it was much easier to deal with computers than humans. I’m not an introvert, though, far from it. But, it happened without explicit thought back in the day. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/celebrating-reflecting-on-my-30-years-career-in-it/">After 30 years in IT</a>, I still think the same, and I often say that the challenge in the information technology field is not about technology per se, but it’s mostly about human issues with technology. Ironically, most of my job today is to build teams of people to make things happen. I’m still focused on technology, but in reality, I try to ensure that all members of a team work towards the same objectives. I’m pretty good about it and people are appreciative of my work. How ironic.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve extensively used <strong>Apple TV</strong> (the physical device), Apple TV+ and the Apple TV app during the holidays to play music, videos, movies and series. One thing is clear: tvOS 17 is a regression in terms of usability, for me anyway. I especially don&rsquo;t like the new left sidebar in the TV app. Navigating back to the home screen is cumbersome, requiring too many &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; back clicks. I often wonder if I&rsquo;m in the Apple TV app or the Apple TV+ service. Up Next queue is intertwined with the rest of the content, it feels less obvious, to me. Content promotion (while starting a new episode, ending a series, etc.) is annoying. Apple feels like Amazon. Apple isn&rsquo;t quite there after so many years of iterative updates.</p>

The savings wouldn&rsquo;t be that substantial. I&rsquo;m paying for two Macs, which is 49$ for a one-year updates license. If new releases come out after that time, the renewal cost will be 19$ to keep receiving them. I know that I&rsquo;ll be upgrading each year to stay current. Updates are relatively frequent and add value. The CleanShot Cloud brings many features and I think are worth the price difference. CleanShot is central to my workflows. I use it all the time.

			 <p><strong>HEY Calendar</strong> is being rolled out to a limited set of users. It will be <strong>free</strong>, and a separate app will be released for the Calendar in the near future. It&rsquo;s not as controversial a take as the email counterpart. Day view and week view only, by design<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is a deal-breaker for many.</p>
<p><strong>Time tracking</strong> seems limited and cannot replace Toggl / Timery in my workflow. Data can be exported as a CSV file. I wonder if it can be really useful in its current form. The jury is still out on that one.</p>
<p>Interesting <strong>habit tracking</strong> support: simple enough to be useful. Limited icon selection, though. No iOS app just yet, only web and desktop. No Microsoft Office 365 support yet. iCloud calendars can be integrated, but they must be made public to get an iCal URL that HEY Calender subscribes to. Same for Google calendars. Some tasks are managed as things to do eventually in the week, appear at the bottom, and move to the next week if not completed.</p>
<p>My initial impressions of HEY Calendar are neutral. That&rsquo;s it for now.</p>

I want to do the opposite: consume a bit more and create a bit less. For me: consuming is often a content creation trigger. Seems contradictory. But consuming more often means better quality of content creation as a source of nourishment.</p>

			 <p>Here is a quick recount of my “Ah ah moment” this morning, involving generative AI in a simple workflow. I’m still in awe about it.</p>
<p>If I stumble on a long and chatty YouTube video that might be interesting, I&rsquo;ll use this workflow to quickly get the gist out of it. First, I use <strong><a href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/">Downie</a></strong> (a Mac utility) to download it on my <strong>M2 MacBook Air</strong>. Then, I use the <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/whisper-transcription/id1668083311?mt=12">Whisper Transcription Mac</a></strong> app to transcribe the spoken discussion into text that I export in a PDF<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Next, I open <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, upload the PDF file and let ChatGPT ingest the content. Finally, I prompt ChatGPT with things like: what is the subject of this discussion? Are there any apps mentioned in the discussion? Who is talking? Is this a controversial subject? Generate a title for this discussion. Generate a summary in less than 300 words. Etc. It’s very effective. You can use <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5FIk9M4IF-youtube-video-interrogator">the GPT</a> I created for this<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Oh, and I guess you can use the same workflow for a podcast episode!</p>
<p>This workflow was also documented in “<a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/my-micro-workflows-explained">My Micro-Workflows Explained</a>” mini website.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/bot.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A recently published <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon">article</a> on The Verge discusses POSSE and the Fediverse: &ldquo;Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.&rdquo; This content strategy emphasizes the importance of owning the content you create by publishing it on your own platform, like a personal blog or website, and then syndicating or sharing that content on other platforms, such as social media or content aggregators.</p>
<p>The main idea behind POSSE is to ensure that creators maintain control over their content. By publishing first on their own platform, creators can establish a primary source for their work that remains under their control. They can then share or syndicate this content to other platforms to reach a wider audience, drive traffic back to their own site, and engage with communities on those platforms.</p>
<p>This strategy is particularly relevant in the digital age, where content creators often face the dilemma of reaching large audiences on popular platforms (like social media networks) while also wanting to maintain ownership and control over their work. POSSE offers a balanced approach, allowing creators to leverage larger platforms’ reach without sacrificing their own site’s autonomy.</p>
<p>I’m practicing POSSE myself; all <a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/content-creator-workflow-update-as-of-2023-04">my online setup</a> is built around it. I depend on two publishing poles: <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://numericcitizen.me">Ghost</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Some find this setup time-consuming and don’t want to be held responsible for replying or engaging on each branch (Mastodon, Bluesky, etc.). My take on this is yes, it might be time-consuming, but I like to engage on each platform because each brings a different type of community. I find it a bit frustrating to reply to someone who systematically shares content from his blog with Mastodon without any reply or acknowledgment. I understand that some posters are very popular and can’t reply to everyone. You can see if someone is replying from time to time. It’s a good idea to check before judging. The danger here is to act like bots if there is no engagement at all.</p>

<p>I don’t know if Apple is working on LLM stuff; they probably do, they probably do work on improving Siri, too, if such a thing is possible in the current incarnation of its fundamentals. But, judging by the rapidity of other companies introducing AI features mainly based on LLM models, I don’t expect it would be so hard for Apple to do the same with Siri. But only if Apple accepts to work with CharGPT-back end for a short-term solution. This could be a transitory path in my mind. Because Apple being Apple, they probably would want to put their twist on this: better privacy protection, for example. They like to control the whole stack. That’s perhaps why they are, apparently, investing massively in their one training infrastructure, which would be they accept the fact that on-device training is too limited, even with powerful Apple silicon. It could prove to be a long journey. I don’t expect too much for next year’s OSes. It will be interesting to see where Apple is headed with this AI thing next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when I’m asking Siri queries today, I cannot help but feel the tech is antiquated compared to what we can do with Whisper and the like today.</p>

<p>First, Apple, a highly-respected company for producing top-quality new product announcements, released new iPhones capable of high-quality filming in September. Next, in October, the company made another top-notch production and announced the first M3-based Macs. Not to be missed, and that is the key here, they slip the following at the very last moment of the presentation:</p>
<p><em>This event was shot on iPhone and edited on Mac.</em></p>

<p>Glass feels right at home in Capture One. Long adored as one of the best platforms for editing and managing a photography workflow, we&rsquo;re thrilled to include publishing to Glass in Capture One.

<p>I like where Glass is going. The choice of Capture One as the first to take advantage of Glass&rsquo;s APIs is telling and sending a message. How long before Publish to Glass support is added to Adobe Lightroom? Months? Years? Ever? How long before we get Fediverse support?</p>

<p>My 2018 12.9 iPad Pro is old. In technology years, it’s super old. However, it’s my favourite iPad and despite many new versions that Apple has since released, I have not been tempted to replace it.
My only issue with this particular iPad is unsurprisingly its battery life. Makes perfect sense. I have used this iPad every day literally for years. In recent months, I could tell it’s not lasting as long. It’s dying within 2 to 3 hours of moderate use. Source: <a href="https://merecivilian.com/apple-denied-my-ipad-pro-battery-replacement/">Apple denied my iPad Pro battery replacement</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s 2018 iPad Pro battery is around 84%. She booked a diagnostic session with an Apple Store technician a few months ago. Same thing: Apple didn&rsquo;t accept to replace the battery unless it was under 80%. Some cynic people could say that Apple wants customers to be frustrated enough with battery life so they upgrade the whole iPad instead of replacing the battery. Personally, this could be an environmental stance, but the fact that it isn&rsquo;t presented this way opens the door for all sorts of theories.</p>

			 <p>I have an issue with <strong><a href="https://short.io">Short.io</a></strong>. I want to contact their support to find a solution to something that partially works, but no contact information is available in the /Support section. The /Blog section shows a small &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; button leading to a page not found error. There is no mail address either. They ask for $ 250 / year for a &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; subscription plan. How can I trust them if I cannot contact them for support?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>🤔</p>
<p>The problem: not all links are leading to the destination page under the go.numericcitizen.me domain name. Why? This used to work for all links, but it&rsquo;s no longer true. Why? Exhibit one: this <a href="https://go.numericcitizen.me/y9LsRdpP">link</a> works. This <a href="https://go.numericcitizen.me/oGNL8uDl">one</a> won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Instead of 404 - Page Not Found, this should be 404 - Support Not Available 😔</p>
<p>Update: I got my answer after chatting with tech support through their chatbox on their website, which wasn&rsquo;t initially showing because of content blocking in Safari. 🤦🏻‍♂️ All is fine now.</p>

			 <p>I finally found the right setup to definitively fix my audio record quality. The problem triggering this endless trial-and-error journey is that the <strong>Blue Yeti microphone</strong> can be too sensitive and pick up too much background noise<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. On paper, the <strong>macOS Voice Isolation</strong> recording should fix this. However, <strong>ScreenFlow 10.0.9</strong> has issues with audio recording from a USB microphone while Voice Isolation is active<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The solution? Use <strong>Audio Highjack</strong><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> to record from the USB microphone with Voice Isolation active and output to the ScreenFlow audio capture driver. When recording, I start the Audio Hijack session, then switch to ScreenFlow and hit record. Voilà. I do use <strong>Adobe Podcast Audio Enhancer</strong> too. The results are quite good! You can hear it in my latest podcast episode. A screenshot of my Audio Hijack workflow is included so you can look at it<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

			 <p>Apparently, Apple is working on a way to upgrade iOS on iPhone still in their box at the Apple Store. This would prevent issues where there is a bug in the final release of iOS that could hinder the upgrade experience of new buyers. I&rsquo;m still wondering how the GM of iOS is installed at the factory and how long it takes to be installed. Is the USB-C port helping make the operation faster? 🤔</p>

			 <p>Discovery of the day: I can use <strong>Audio Hijack</strong> with <strong>ScreenFlow</strong> to record the Mac audio from the <strong>Finch Pixel USB-C</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> mic and the Mac screen. Why use Audio Hijack? Well, so that it can use the macOS Voice Isolation feature and output the results to the Mac audio, which the special audio driver of ScreenFlow, in turn, picks up.

			 <p>With recent events in Israel, we no longer hear about the conflict in Ukraine. I understand this could pose a problem for this conflict because people’s attention is severely diverted.

There is no magic here, to fully reverse the dynamic in Ukraine, look no further than into Israel’s army reaction to the Hammas. The West needs to sharply increase their support, not the opposite, in order to kick the Russians out of Ukraine.</p>

			 <p>Objective: find a replacement for my lightning-based Finch Lavalier microphone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Did my research for a USB-C microphone. RODE microphones came up quite often. They received good reviews. I ordered the NT-USB model. It was hard to see which type of USB port it came with—I got the microphone<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. It comes with USB-A. Shit. It was tested on my Mac mini. Background noises are too easily picked up. Screenflow cannot use voice isolation<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. It was tested on my iPhone 15 Pro Max with a USB-A to USB-C adaptor and Ferrite. Voice isolation isn’t possible, either. Not good. I tried to use the RODE companion app for Mac so I could adjust the microphone operating parameters. I downloaded and installed it but didn’t recognize the microphone when plugged in. Not good. It’s an expansive microphone, barely better than my Blue Yeti. Not good. After testing Screenflow, my iPhone connected via USB-C to my Mac, and with voice isolation￼ activated once again<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, I decided to return the product. It’s way better, close to what I had with my Finch microphone. Problem solved.</p>

			 <p>For those looking to buy a <strong>Peak Design</strong> case for the <strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>, just like I did. I love the case but&hellip; here&rsquo;s the kicker; the action button is really hard to press with this case, the cutout should have a button instead which would press the action button, just like for the other buttons integrated into the case. They plan to fix this. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/Qjc7InZ7D-I?si=uWMc0YabCzqia8IS">this video</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>Update: The way the company is handling this issue is a prime example of how customer satisfaction should be handled. Bravo.</p>

			 <p>I have a folder named &ldquo;Noto&rdquo; in my iCloud Drive folder that keeps populating empty folders inside of it, on all my devices. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/noto-review-beautifully-modern-and-versatile-note-taking/">Noto</a> is a note-taking app that I tried in Feb. 2020. Today, I found out that I had more than 30K empty folders sitting there. I deleted the folders from my Mac mini, and it came back. Same with the MacBook Air. It came back. I visited all my devices to see if Noto was still installed. Nope. I reinstalled it on the iPad to see if it would populate something. Nope. I went on Files.app on the iPad to delete the root folder. Still re-appearing. On all my devices, I reinstalled Noto, to disable iCloud sync. I visited the iCloud storage section within Settings on the iPhone. The Noto folder isn&rsquo;t there. But, on the iPad, it was there. I deleted the item from iCloud storage management. Yet, the folder keeps coming back. What a strange bug. Help.</p>
<p>Update: the issue went away after rebooting my M2 MacBook Air to fix an issue with Screenflow screen recording permission request. I went back to the iCloud Drive folder and sure enough, the Noto folder didn&rsquo;t come back. I guess the issue is resolved.</p>

			 <p>I read in recent days that the <strong>Craft</strong> team is supposedly very interested and invested in <strong>AI for Craft</strong>. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is good news. Notes and document-writing apps should focus on the core experience and capabilities to support the writing process. Today, I don&rsquo;t see AI at the core for most people (yet). AI should be a complementary feature. There are so many things to be improves and fixed in Craft; I&rsquo;m afraid they spend too much time on the AI stuff while neglecting the bugs and highly requested basic features, again.😔</p>

			 <p>One of the most confusing parts of iOS and iPadOS UI: configuring <strong>the share sheet options</strong>. The ⊕ sign and the toggle meaning are utterly confusing each time I visit this portion of the UI. The fact that some non-favourite items can be toggled on or off is probably part of the explanation for my confusion. I&rsquo;m confused about my confusion. I must be getting old. 👴🏻</p>

Rounded contours are really making a difference. The device feels more approachable. The screen is so nice. The setup process is superbly executed. An update to iOS was required before transferring the content from my iPhone 13 Pro. Yet, there were many apps which required reentering my credentials. Data transfer was estimated at one hour<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The data transfer took about 45 minutes.

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Apple&rsquo;s new AirPods features for the past week, and I&rsquo;m sad to say that I don&rsquo;t really understand either of them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Matt here. I fail to find the magic here. I&rsquo;ve read Gruber&rsquo;s take on the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, and I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t feel anything magical about <strong>Adaptive Audio</strong>. When activated, I hear too much from the surroundings; I prefer noise cancellation. Can we get adaptive noise cancellation instead? 🤔</p>
<p>I feel that Apple&rsquo;s engineers couldn&rsquo;t figure out which new audio profiles to include and couldn&rsquo;t decide, and they suggested including both. Then, the marketing guys came in and named these profiles Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness. Boom. I&rsquo;m half-joking here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep trying in the next few days to find the magic.</p>

			 <p>Today, I read many <strong>iPhone 15 Pro reviews</strong> and watched many YouTube videos too. For some reason, I get the feeling of a slight deception mood across many reviewers. Those are great upgrades, but since they are compared to last year&rsquo;s iPhone, the improvements are dimmed as mostly minor. A mentioned the superiority of the iPhone in the video recording field, but in the photography field, it&rsquo;s less clear. Sharpening seems a tad less aggressive with more natural tones. The 24MP resolution by default is a welcomed addition, and yet&hellip; it&rsquo;s not a home run. Device physical tweaks are unanimously welcomed, though. Maybe tomorrow, my interpretation will be different. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

			 <p>Many apps are getting updates today and this week. Yes! 😃 But, so far, I have found some bugs in iOS 17 to display <strong>interactive widget</strong> content once they are added. They often stay blank with a white background. Rebooting doesn&rsquo;t help. I don&rsquo;t know if it is an iOS 17 bug or an issue with the app. 🤔 One design issue: if an app supports the <strong>StandBy mode</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, it should also support the landscape orientation, not only the portrait orientation. Tapping a widget to launch the app and the app comes up in portrait mode. It&rsquo;s bad. WaterMinder is such an example, and&hellip; Apple&rsquo;s Stocks app! The latter is inexcusable. In general, StandBy mode seems a work-in-press, to be honest.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

			 <p>This is how much forests burned so far this summer in Canada. ☹️ There are still close to a thousand fires still in action. This is freaking bad for so many reasons. First, we need forests to remove CO2. In a sense, removing trees diminishes the capacity of nature to limit climate change. We lose this capability.  Second, all that burning created a lot of CO2. Third, it will take half a century to regain those lost forests.😔 It&rsquo;s really hard to feel positive about our future.</p>

<p>These are my impressions of Apple’s latest product announcements.</p>
<p>The mother nature segment was funny, and I smiled quite often. It was a great way to communicate their progress toward better environmental protection and reduced carbon footprint. Video production quality was top-notch. Aren’t tech press people tired of going to Apple Park to watch a movie?</p>
<p>Many comments during the presentation about the desire by Apple to see people go into their stores to buy and activate the new iPhones<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We got a short update about the upcoming Apple Vision Pro, which is still on track for early 2024. That was expected but felt a bit short.</p>
<p>Onto the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch Series 9 is a mildly interesting update. The new finger gestures are cool but only for Series 9. Too bad. I’ll probably buy a few new bands later this fall. I’ll skip this year’s updates and wait for next year’s rumoured redesign.</p>
<p>Moving to the star of the show. The iPhone.</p>
<p>The iPhone remains the crown jewel of Apple. Everything else is peripheral. The design of the Pro line is absolutely gorgeous (rounded edges, great pro finishes). The A17 Pro (bye-bye Bionic) is a powerhouse CPU! I’ll go with the 15 Pro Max with 512 GB of storage. I’ll order the “<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUQX3AM/A/usb-c-to-lightning-adapter">USB-C to Lightning adaptor</a>” to keep using my excellent Cavalier microphone (see <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/09/11/first-world-problem.html">my previous blog post about the issue</a>).</p>
<p>The black finish is my choice with a blue FineWoven case<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Best of both worlds. Thanks to <a href="https://youtu.be/H34jCFLyPaM?si=J_MNeSBhWnEoUdIg">this video</a>, which helped me confirm my decision<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Those wallpapers are gorgeous, too! This is the first time in a while that I love them so much. I’m overall happy with this year’s Pro finishes and tones. Very classy.</p>
<p>I’m a bit surprised by the battery life capacity to be the same as last year’s Pro models. I was expecting longer battery life with the A17, but I guess since we get more features… something has to give. I expect next year’s iPad Pro to use a derivative of the A17 Pro announced today.</p>
<p>About cameras. A 5x range for telephoto, not 6x<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. I’m surprised it’s not 6x. But 120mm is great for travelling. Shooting with the phone and having the preview immediately available on the Mac, just like pros are expecting. Wow. Do images on the 15 Pro line have less over-processing / sharpening? I certainly hope so. And about those immersive spacial videos to be shot on the 15 Pro but visioned on the Apple Vision Pro, coming later this year. Consider me intrigued<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The camera app has a few tweaks, judging by some video segments, for the 2x mode, where you can select the focal length. Cool.</p>
<p>There is no monstrous price increase, which is good. Some price adjustments on the entry-level iPhone 15 Pro Max. The speed limit of the USB-C on the non-Pro line is ridiculous<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. iCloud+ storage tier at 6TB is a surprise, still 5GB<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> at the entry-level, though. I like the action button flexibility.</p>
<p>I’ll order my new phone this Friday. That is all for now.</p>

			 <p>Here are some more details about my excitement for the next iPhone<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Besides the camera upgrades, here is a short list of things I’m looking forward to with the next iPhones.</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m going to the Max. It’s the first Max model that I’m getting<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li>I expect better battery life than the iPhone 14 Pro Max<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. I want a real all-day battery life for when I travel abroad.</li>
<li>I never liked the current chrome finish of the Pro line (since the iPhone 12 Pro)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. I like the titanium finish of the Apple Watch. I can’t wait to see the tweaked version for the iPhone<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</li>
<li>I’m ambivalent about the rumoured action button. I’ll want to configure it for the camera capture, but I want to keep the mute button.</li>
<li>The always-on display… I’m not sure. My wife has an iPhone 14 Pro, she disabled the always-on display because of the battery drain. I’ll see with the Max.</li>
<li>I’m curious about the grey version, but I will go either with a deep blue<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> or the darkest one<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</li>
<li>I love the Dynamic Island. My hope is to see wider adoption by developers.</li>
<li>Finally, USB-C. Finally. 95% of the time, I charge my iPhone with MagSafe. It’s too convenient. On rare occasions, it will be handy to grab any normal USB-C cable and plug it in. As for transfer speed, I’m not in any use cases for this<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll catch you on the other side of the Wonderlust event.</p>

</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>The chrome look on anything always felt like cheap luxury to me. I prefer textures.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I’m curious about anything that is blue. I could wait until iPhones make their way to the Apple Store, but I won’t be able to last that long.

X is not taking over at all. Services or apps that depend on Twitter for logging in, news sites asking people to join them via social networks, apps offering a sharing action or whatever the needs are, most continue to use Twitter’s original branding.

<p>What a strange move by Apple. This <a href="https://www.apple.com/apps/">website made by Apple</a> promotes first-party apps for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc. Why? Why now? I would understand in the context of being forced to allow third-party App Stores. Apple reminding people about their apps while people are getting excited by <strong>side-loading</strong> and <strong>third-party App Stores</strong> would make sense. Is Apple up to something here? They usually plan for the long run. This could be the first baby step for a more open ecosystem.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> 👀</p>

<p>Remember when people and tech pundits pressed Apple to create a <strong>Netbook</strong>? Apple responded with an 11-inch MacBook (2008) Air and an iPad (2010). I hope they skip trying to make a low-cost MacBook and keep improving on the current iPad story instead. That being said, I understand Chromebooks are giving Apple a hard time in education. 🥵</p>

			 <p>Om Malik on Threads capabilities in regards to sharing and consuming photo content: <a href="https://om.co/2023/08/30/threads-twitter-social-photos/">Threads, Twitter, &amp; Social Photos</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The design is particularly conducive to viewing photos. The white space, the way the photos are rendered, and the styling of photo collections enhance the overall presentation. The vibe on Threads is the polar opposite. Even John Gruber, a long-time critic of Facebook, has been vocal in his appreciation of this new product from the same company. It’s surprising to see him overlooking the poor privacy-related track record of the Facebook family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, Threads offers photos and photographers a second chance to find a home beyond a dying Instagram.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I deeply respect Mr. Malik😒, but there is zero chance that fancy web design will erase Meta&rsquo;s business practices and business model. I refuse to consider Threads as an alternative to Instagram. It&rsquo;s a matter of time before Threads becomes another Instagram-type platform. Just wait for it. Now, excuse me, I have some photos to post on Glass and Pixelfed. Thank you. 😜</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Mac feels too much like a computer that has felt too overwhelming and the iPad is like the smartphone they have already been using.</p>

<p>At some point in the more or less distant future, the iPad form factor will take over. Just like cars took over trucks a long time ago. Just like most people use a smartphone as their main computer or as their only computer, the iPad will eventually be regarded as &ldquo;a real computer&rdquo;, the only computer, if people are willing to add something on top of their iPhone. One day.</p>

<p>This is going to be about the iPhone, mostly. The <strong>iPhone 15</strong>, to be more precise. Of course. Apple will probably talk a lot about the <strong>A17</strong> because of its new 3nm manufacturing process, ensuring some battery power savings while bringing faster processing. This will be welcomed for an always-on display device since the iPhone 14 Pro performance in that respect is not as good as it used to be. Will the A17 be Bionic? Something else? I trust Apple’s marketing cracks about this.</p>
<p>The <strong>titanium</strong> finish on the Pro line, a first for the iPhone, but something the Apple Watch is already sporting, will get some attention too. Maybe more than the A17. I’m looking forward to it because I wouldn’t say I like the current finish on the iPhone 14 Pro<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I hate it, actually. Thanks to my iPhone case, it’s a non-issue. If the Apple invite is any indication of the upcoming titanium colour finish, I’m in love already!</p>
<p>But the star of the iPhone 15 show will be the Ultra with the <strong>periscope lens</strong>, bringing telephoto photography beyond the 3x optic possibilities for the first time. This is what I’m waiting for. I expect an Apple twist to it.</p>
<p>I expect some updates about the <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Apple will probably talk<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> about how excited developers are for the device and remind us about how it will change the world<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Something on the gaming front could be in the cards, too, thanks to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/tags/game-porting-toolkit">game porting toolkit</a> introduced at the WWDC conference. Are Macs finally good at gaming? Is a software trick enough?</p>
<p>And then what else? The Apple Watch will get updates, but not the redesign we are starting to hear about for 2024. The Ultra 2 is probably not for me. But we will learn about it, for sure.</p>
<p>Macs? Crickets.</p>
<p>This is what I expect for the upcoming “Wonderlust” event.</p>

			 <p>I’m really looking forward to the <strong>iPhone 15 Ultra</strong>👀.

<p>I played with Apple’s Maps Places feature, as shown in <a href="https://youtu.be/i4fuAVWE55I?si=07Bq3diduMP43j0O">the following video</a>. It’s nice, but it’s not exactly intuitive. There are many missing features, like setting a path between places and adding photos to a place within the guide, from the Photos.app for example to name a few. Also, it’s not clear if a shared guide gets updated if new places are added, or places are removed.</p>

<p>The design of Dark Sky was so wonderful that I could understand the shape of the weather at a glance, even from a zoomed out view of the app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great analysis of the now-defunct <strong>Dark Sky</strong> weather app. I&rsquo;m a bit late on that one. I don&rsquo;t remember using Dark Sky because I think it wasn&rsquo;t working in Canada. I&rsquo;m not sure about this. Once Apple took over and brought the redesigned weather app with iOS 16, we could visually feel the Dark Sky&rsquo;s influence on it. But Apple being Apple, they dropped a few things here and there and made a few things their own. I tend to use <strong>Carrot Weather</strong> more, but recently, I deep-dived into Apple&rsquo;s Weather, and frankly, they did a good job. Yet, there was something unique in Dark Sky that I don&rsquo;t feel in Apple&rsquo;s offerings. Is it too close to the <strong>Yahoo Weather</strong> look &amp; feel? Maybe.</p>

How much effort does it require to make an iPad app available on the Mac without having to depend on Catalyst? 🤔</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are effectively no success stories for Glass’s current business model. Small clones of Instagram and Twitter usually fail. To break out, there has to be something fundamentally different. For Micro.blog, the answer is simple: we are a social network but our business is blog hosting, a proven model. For Glass, the answer is less clear: they care deeply about photography, community, and design. I think the founders deserve a lot of credit for creating something beautiful. Is that enough?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My recent enthusiasm for <strong>Pixelfed</strong> comes down to being a good alternative to Instagram, open and not afflicted by a toxic business model. It might become a good alternative to Glass too if the latter doesn&rsquo;t open up a little bit more to the modern world, post Meta-as-we-know-it.</p>

I&rsquo;m super impressed by the logistics behind all of it and how the user (me) is guided in the process.  The final step was to cancel the <strong>AppleCare+</strong> that I originally bought with my old device. Took a 5 min call from somewhere in Texas. The call was automatically initiated from a web form I filled out by selecting a few options. Got a confirmation email before the call and after stating the actual amount of the refund. All done. Great user experience. The next time will be for the replacement of my iPhone 13 Pro with the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro. 😃</p>

<p>The situation with Trump and his extensive use of Twitter and how Twitter responded to the search warrant/court order confirms that leaving Twitter was one of my best decision in a long time. Twitter&rsquo;s actions to protect Trump are disgusting (telling him that there is a search warrant targeting his use of the platform). I cannot, in good faith, be on such platforms.</p>

			 <p>Being locked out of an Apple ID account is probably one of the worst nightmares I could imagine. This story (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/15gechw/apple_just_stole_hundreds_of_dollars_from_me/">Reddit link</a>) makes me pause for a bit. If you spend some time reading the comments thread, it seems the original poster doesn&rsquo;t tell the whole story. There are some grey zones here. Nonetheless, the possibility of losing complete access to my previously purchased and subscribed content is really something that I wouldn&rsquo;t want. I would feel helpless.</p>
<p>Mike Rockwell&rsquo;s <a href="https://initialcharge.net/2023/08/locked-out-apple-id/">comment</a> on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope we’re nearing a future where you can realistically use an iPhone without an Apple ID at all — replacing all of Apple’s services, including the App Store, with independent alternatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike&rsquo;s wishes are not going to be fulfilled anytime soon. Even with alternative authentication mechanisms and third-party stores, the prospect of losing access to previously purchased content is real. Somehow I think the government should step in and ask companies to provide secure content recovery means.</p>

			 <p>Ok, can we agree that Apple&rsquo;s <strong>Migration Assistant</strong> is magical? 🤯 After the new Mac got updated, it was required to match the version of the source Mac. It took about 45 minutes to transfer 375GB of data (with a peak speed of 650MB/s over Thunderbolt 4 cable), and boom. Of course, I had all those required permissions to be set again. But, wow, writing this on my brand new 15-inch MacBook Air this morning. It was my first experience with this process of getting a new Mac set up. I already feel at home on this machine.</p>

			 <p>Recently, while on a flight with United from Tenerife to Newark, I played with the infotainment screen in front of me. These infotainment systems really improved in recent years. Screens are bigger, speed is much faster, and interaction has improved quite a bit. Some of these systems look like iPad-in-the-seat, literally. It occurred to me that Apple while offering CarPlay, could try to find a way to create a version for flight infotainment systems. Let&rsquo;s call it <strong>FlightPlay</strong> because Flighty is already used, and AirPlay, too!</p>
<p>I want each plane to offer a complete set of flight data, ready to be consumed by my iPad or iPhone while in flight via a local wifi network. The iPhone or the iPad would then turn into a special StandBy mode where data would be visually presented dynamically, allowing for great interactions with the user. Modern devices have so much powerful CPU, the interaction would be much more fluid and enjoyable. The data provided would be based on a standard model and would provide speed, altitude, current destination, path, atmosphere metrics (temp, headwind speed, etc.), and so much more. The airplane company could directly provide TV shows, music, etc., to our devices. The same would be for games. But Apple could also allow consumption of locally stored content from the device itself. I can imagine Apple&rsquo;s designers working on a great graphical dashboard.</p>
<p>Is anybody at Apple reading this? What are you waiting for?</p>

			 <p>Thought of the day: sometimes, what you decide not to do is as important as what you decide to do! For bloggers and writers, for me at least, writing is fundamental to my existence, publishing and sharing, a lot less. I have many unfinished pieces that probably will never be shared with the world. And that is ok.</p>

			 <p>Earlier this summer, when Apple&rsquo;s OSes were at Beta 3, I installed iPadOS 17 on my iPad to test the latest improvements and additions to a maligned OS. Maybe I was bored too. I started gathering my notes, thinking that it would be part of a mini review. Then I upgraded my iPhone because my experience with iPadOS 17 was good for a beta. Then I upgraded both of my Apple Watch (Series 4 and Series 8). Then my two Apple TVs. All is good, and generally speaking, these are all great improvements to what can be considered a set of mature OSes. I tried to put my observations together, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth it. Besides having the general impression of getting a new Apple Watch, thanks to Apple, who dare to revisit many fundamental aspects of the UI and many micro-interactions with watchOS 10, for all other platforms, most of the changes are great and show that Apple is headed in the right direction. Your mileage may vary, and this is ok. The end.</p>

Microsoft is clear in that respect and already shows what the alternatives are. Siri is a high-value brand name.

Is the iPhone refined enough? It depends on how you define « refinement ». To me, the iPhone isn’t refined enough in a way that new tech can help make the iPhone even better. If this year’s rumors are true, this is exactly what will happen (faster processor, more power efficient, etc.). Craftmanship also is a big part of the refinement story (softer edges, etc.). I can&rsquo;t wait for iPhone 15 Pro, coming from the 13 Pro, I&rsquo;ll certainly enjoy all the refinements, big and small.</p>
<p>Oh and apparently, unlike Apple, other companies don’t bother keeping the refinement game going. Well, this is exactly why I love Apple, they care to refine and try to improve things, year after year.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been playing with Micro.blog’s new <strong>bookmark tags</strong>. At first, I thought the feature was underwhelming. I don&rsquo;t think there is a way to add more than one tag to a bookmark. This might be a good thing after all. Still undecided on this. Then, I discovered how you can select a tag to display associated bookmarks. Hoping for the iOS app to receive an update soon. I updated a few dozen bookmarks to add a tag. I&rsquo;ll see if it makes a difference. My bookmarks are not that many and many are deleted after a while.</p>
<p>Update #1: someone pointed me that we can have more than one tag, simply by adding commas.
Update #2: I can see Micro.blog bookmarks as a complement to Anybox, but focused on content originating from people I follow on Micro.blog / Mastodon. I don’t see that replacing Anybox anytime soon.</p>

			 <p>👉🏻 <strong>Thought of the day</strong>: when people put responsibility for solving the climate crisis and the like on the governments and big companies, it&rsquo;s a clever (or not so clever way) to NOT take responsibility as an individual. It&rsquo;s too easy.</p>
<p>Governments &amp; companies are made of and operated by people, for god sake! No willingness by the people, individually or in a government, produces the exact same result: no action. But what action can we take as an individual, you might ask? Revisit your consumption habits might eventually help. Less consumption = less need for recycling. Simple.</p>
<p>Meanwhile: the planet IS burning.</p>

<p>I decided to support <strong>Glass</strong> as a patron because I think these alternatives are important. They help create some sort of equilibrium.

			 <p>Now that I&rsquo;m a subscriber of <strong>Tapbots</strong>&rsquo; <strong>Ivory</strong> client for Mastodon, what&rsquo;s up with the updates? Is it because it&rsquo;s summertime? Why do I feel that the development of new features and improvements has considerably slowed in recent weeks and months? After all, the roadmap is clear <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Tweetbot followed the same trend. Not all developers or companies follow the same product releases, but regarding Tapbots, the trend is slowing and is a pattern. Now, look at Mastodon&rsquo;s official client; there is an update nearly every two weeks or at least monthly. Ok, there are more than 40 contributors to the open source project of r the iOS app while Tapbots is a three-person company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ok with subscriptions, but just like the subscription itself, the commitment from the developer has to keep up. The subscription model is everywhere and is here to stay. The software and services landscape has changed forever. Expectations from customers like me are changing too. It&rsquo;s too easy to grab my money regularly without showing up in the App Store &ldquo;Updates&rdquo; tab.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching you, Tapbots. Don&rsquo;t deceive me again.</p>
<p>Yeah, Tweetbot was a great app, just like Ivory is, but it lacked some love in the last few years before its demise.</p>
<p>Ranting off. Sorry.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m testing <strong>Paste</strong>, a clipboard manager software utility for Mac, iOS (<a href="https://pasteapp.io">link</a>). I kind of like it. It has better management features than <strong>Unclutter</strong>, which also offers some clipboard management. I&rsquo;m on a 14-day trial period, but 19 $CAN, a year for a utility without a one-time purchase option, is bugging me. Will see where it goes.</p>

			 <p>I recently read about the news that <strong>Evernote</strong> is currently downsizing its operations worldwide, especially in the US. It&rsquo;s not the first troubling episode for Evernote. I remember when they &ldquo;redesigned&rdquo; their app, which created a massive pushback from the community.</p>
<p>I used Evernote in its early days and was appreciative of its capabilities. For some reason, I left for another solution. But for those who built massive data collections inside Evernote, now might be the time to think about going elsewhere. But there is a big gotcha: after searching for a way to export all the data, I discovered that it&rsquo;s not that easy. And people are angry. This brings me to the data portability of modern software and services. Evernote&rsquo;s ENEX export format was not a standard the last time I checked. A handful of apps can import ENEX files; Notion is one of them. HTML is also supported but is far from ideal. Options are limited and are seriously hindering the data portability of services like Evernote. Besides content, metadata is also critical (tags, dates, location, backlinks, etc.).</p>
<p>Is <strong>Notion</strong> suffering from the same potential issues? PDF, CSV, and HTML are the supported formats. 🤔</p>

Then, I realized that without knowing it, I&rsquo;m actually using the <a href="https://youtu.be/T6Mfl1OywM8">PARA</a> approach in Craft. Now I&rsquo;m wondering if I should rearrange and rename a few things in there to better align with the <strong>PARA</strong> naming convention. 🤔

I do sense a few red flags here and there, though. More on that later. But for now, I enjoy the beginning of the ride.</p>

			 <p>When I decided to use Day One for my travel journal, I had the following requirements:</p>

<li>Data portability is paramount (markdown, text, or textbundle);</li>

<li>Integration into my existing workflow to share travel moments on Micro.blog;</li>
<li>Easy data entry with as much metadata automatically filled out for me as possible;</li>
<li>Look at <a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/meta-toolset">my current toolset</a> before using something entirely new.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried <strong>Craft</strong> <a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/italy2022">last year</a>, and it wasn&rsquo;t up to the task. <strong>Apple Notes</strong> was a candidate, but it was dropped since notes’ metadata is nonexistent. <strong>Day One</strong> met all requirements.

			 <p>Yesterday, <strong>weather report</strong> summary for June in Canada was released and it is ugly. Much higher temperatures in the wrong places and at much earlier time this year. Many records broken by wide margin (since 1871). Lot’s of discrepancies in rain distribution with lack of rain in the north of Quebec which then allowed much widespread forests fire than usual.</p>
<p>One month is not a trend but when you look far back, there are many worrying trends.</p>

			 <p>Hunters are not allowed to use drones to locate their prey. It is seen as an anti-competitive measure or an unfair practice. While “<em>real</em>” hunters who chase their future prey for fun aren’t allowed drone usage, what about those who hunt to eat meat because it is their way of living? Is it still forbidden?</p>
<p>Now, let’s do a parallel with LLM-derived tools like ChatGPT. Is it ok for fun but not ok for actual work? When are the lines crossed? Is the content the only determining factor?</p>

			 <p>I have spent the last two days at an all-inclusive in Agadir, Morocco. It’s quite busy here with a lot of people everywhere. People are from Morocco and mostly Europe. I don’t see many Russian (none actually).</p>
<p>The worst part of our experience here is at the buffet. People are eating way too much, because, it’s free or because they “paid for it”, so they are entitled. Yet, the amount of wasted food is astronomical. I would argue that 80% of people here are fat, 20% in advanced stage of being fat. Many people are rude with the personal (because they paid for it?). It’s sad. Many people lack the basic sense of why “waiting in line”. They skip, they bypass and they don’t give a damn. It’s a circus.</p>

<p>Visiting this Medina was like reliving the past, like going back in 800. Our guide told us that not that many things has changed since the early years. But man, everything is so coupled with the Islamic religion. I’m not used to that.</p>
<p>The Medina is a city in a city. You’ll find everything from food, clothes, and fake Apple gear (a lot). Oh, and, the young generation of sellers are all tied to their smartphone, all the time. I’m not sure this helps do good business. 🤔</p>

			 <p>Just finished configuring my <strong>WhatsApp</strong> account on my iPhone. What a weird user experience. I couldn&rsquo;t get my verification code to be sent by SMS after many tries. Finally asked to be called. WhatsApp asked me if I wanted to restore data from a non-existent iCloud backup. My account is configured with my current phone number which I&rsquo;m pretty sure won&rsquo;t work once I&rsquo;m in Morocco. I bet that changing this phone number will require me to access my SMS on my primary line, which won&rsquo;t be possible because I&rsquo;ll depend on an eSIM. I&rsquo;m not sure what is my &ldquo;WhatsApp handle&rdquo; either if such a thing exists. What is I prefer to use my email address so people can find me? I should probably spend an hour googling to sort this out.</p>
<p>And WhatsApp is the de-facto standard in most parts of the world, except North America.</p>

			 <p>Warning: it&rsquo;s not about the <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong> headset, which many people think will bring a touch of a dystopian future to our life. Something else more serious will.</p>
<p>I read this week somewhere that, to get <strong>climate</strong> back into the normality zone🌪️ to ensure the sustainability of the human race and life in general, everyone on earth would need to live in an oppressive world where everything would be controlled by laws and government all the time and for decades. From buying food to cars to travelling to entertainment services, we would be under constant quotas, which would bring our quality of life much lower than we currently enjoy. In fact, developed countries&rsquo; quality of life would join the much lower quality of life of the vast majority of the earth&rsquo;s population in less developed countries. This would be the only way to get around this climate crisis. Not convinced? The COVID pandemic brought massive and repetitive confinements that weren&rsquo;t enough to bend many climate change indicators downwards. It lasted two years, more or less. 😱</p>
<p>Oh, and should we talk about forced birth control everywhere? Because we should, even if this is a taboo subject.</p>
<p>Are we ready for this dystopian world? 😷</p>
<p>I can see a great Vision Pro use case right here where people watch daylong movies about what used to be a much more enjoyable world in 3D. 😒</p>

It has a lot of potential. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with my current work. I sometimes find it a bit laggy, but let&rsquo;s keep the experiment running for a few months.😃</p>

<p>Nobody talks about the device&rsquo;s size when you use it on your lap like I do with my MBA right now as I write this post. It&rsquo;s an important factor to consider for such laptop category which the MBA is targeting. Are 15 inches too wide? Is it still comfortable? For some reason, I have a few doubts. This 15-inch MacBook Air is&hellip; big, but is it too big for me? 🤔</p>
<p>When I come back from vacation, a visit to the Apple Store will help me decide once and for all.</p>

			 <p>A day at the office. Today, I had a meeting with my client&rsquo;s external IT resources. One of them had a strange name, hard to pronounce. While waiting for everyone to join the meeting, wanting to fill in the silence, I asked where he was from. He responded, &ldquo;Russia.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; 😱 This was followed by a big silence while I could see in mack back my Tidbyt display showing a prominent Ukrainian flag. 🇺🇦👊🏻We moved on to the meeting&rsquo;s first subject. 😏😂</p>
<p>A colleague of mine told me after the meeting that not all Russians are ok with this war in Ukraine. Yeah, right. I guess. This is not a valuable excuse in my book. Where are the diaspora demonstrations, in Canada? In the US?</p>
<p>Women in Iran have more courage to defend democratic values than those men in Russia to defend what is blatantly right from what is wrong. This is utterly frustrating.</p>

			 <p>My nephew, a semi-pro photographer, recently sold 90% of his photography gear (<strong>Canon</strong>). He only kept one body and one 50mm lens. 😱 He upgraded his phone to the iPhone 14 Pro. 😏He couldn&rsquo;t be happier, he told me. Even with the iPhone, he essentially kept his photo-processing workflow as-is (Adobe Lightroom). This makes me pause a bit. Sure, he spends much less time doing professional photography work, but still. I call this the iPhone-photography killer effect.</p>
<p>He got his first exposure (pun intended) to the art of photography with me when he was still a child, more than thirty years ago, when he accompanied me for a short photowalk. He demonstrated that he could be a photographer, even at this young age, just by his numerous questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring my small (but heavy) camera gear (<strong>Nikon</strong>) on my trip to Morocco and when I visit the Canary Islands later this summer. Will these trips be the last ones where I use the big one? 🤔 I know that I&rsquo;m going to upgrade my iPhone 13 Pro to the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro Max later this fall. This could trigger a similar fate to my camera bag.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still digesting everything we heard and saw today. Like someone wrote today: what was that? I already read good (and dumb) reactions here and there, from which I&rsquo;m trying to stay away, just to focus and maybe get my analysis and perspective one of my own. That&rsquo;s not easy; it&rsquo;s so noisy out there right now. Stay tuned for later this week.</p>

<p>It’s Apple keynote day, and it is exciting but also stressful! Here are last-minute questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will the headset pricing be announced today?</li>
<li>Will the headset be like the Apple Watch and be running apps, or will it be more like CarPlay, with some additional viewport from the iPhone? Or a combination?</li>
<li>Is the headset unveiled with a “one more thing” segment?</li>
<li>When the iPad was announced, Steve Jobs spent some time explaining its relative position within the use cases spectrum of our computing devices. Where does the headset fit?</li>
<li>Will the headset announcement overshadow Apple’s timid foray into generative AI?</li>
<li>Is Xcode finally coming to the iPad?</li>
<li>Can we infer something about the rumors setting the price 1999$ when we compare that to the AirPods Max price?</li>
<li>Tim Cook’s air time has decreased in recent events, is the trend continuing today?</li>
<li>Can we expect another meme moment from <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/leadership/craig-federighi/">Craig Federighi</a>?</li>
<li>Who’s going to present the headset? <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/leadership/jeff-williams/">Jeff Williams</a>, just like for the Apple Watch Ultra?</li>
<li>Can any of the announcements today affect my Apple hardware upgrade plan?</li>
</ul>
<p>For someone who’s not interested in the headset, I have far too many questions about it. I’ll return to this post once the event is complete to fill in the answers!</p>

			 <p>👉🏻 This is <strong>WWDC day</strong>! Here are some informative tidbits. Two weeks ago, I set up a fake meeting in my work calendar for the entire afternoon (EST time here). I’ll be out of the office for the whole afternoon. I’ve been doing that for more than ten years. It worked 9 out of 10 times. I should be good to go today.</p>
<p>I’ll watch the keynote from within Safari to take screenshots (with the TV app, screenshots don’t work 🤔). Then, using a configured button on my <strong>StreamDeck</strong> mini, I’ll take the screenshots that will be saved and moved to my <strong>Synology</strong> NAS automatically; thanks to <strong>Hazel</strong>. The excellent Mastodon client, <strong>Ivory</strong>, will be running too side-by-side so that I can see reactions coming in. Sadly, feed streaming is not yet a thing on Mastodon, apparently.</p>
<p>My expectations are relatively low for all the tech announcements but high for the keynote production value and quality.</p>

I&rsquo;m unsure if I&rsquo;ll go on <strong>Mastodon</strong> or <strong>Bluesky</strong> to read the room temperature. I&rsquo;ll see. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just make up my own mind, too, which is a good thing. 🤔💭</p>

			 <p>Here’s a short “life at the office” story. Our VP of sales never stops bragging about how <strong>ChatGPT</strong> is cool and how it works for him for many use cases. I’m uncomfortable with his stance on ChatGPT &amp; generative AI in general. I think about it each time he sends an email that was obviously created with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Why is it a problem for me? Who am I to judge him and his “new way of working”? I think I have found the root cause.</p>
<p>First, it’s not the results of his work. It’s the work of something else. He takes something “as is” without adding any value, any personal opinion, or a personal twist. Second, the fundamental problem is that he works in IT but is not a tech guy. He is a salesperson. He’s the type of guy who surfs on buzzwords a lot. Using ChatGPT makes him circumvent his lack of confidence because of a lack of IT knowledge and culture. He probably feels better and more “into the game” like most of my other colleagues, who studied computer science before getting to work in IT.</p>
<p>How many more people lack my colleague do the same, for the same reason?</p>

			 <p>For my next trip, I will bring my <strong>Nikon D750</strong> and my <strong>iPhone 13 Pro</strong> (of course!), and my 2018 11-inch <strong>iPad Pro</strong>. How am I going to process my images? Will I continue using <strong>Lightroom</strong> for images from my Nikon? I usually use the iPad to import my photos into the Lightroom catalogue. What about pictures on my iPhone, which should be mostly in RAW format and shot with <strong>Halide</strong>? I like <strong>Photomator</strong> a lot; it is nicer than Lr and more approachable too. However, using Photomator to process images from my Nikon poses a challenge in file management. I’ll need to import the .NEF files from my SD card into my iPad in an <strong>iCloud Drive</strong> folder so I can work on imported files from any device (iPad, MacBook Air or iPhone). I prefer using iCloud Photos Library instead of managing files manually. I guess this will be this combo: Photomator + Halide for my “shot on iPhone” images!</p>
<p>Just writing this blog post made things a little bit less fuzzy. I’ll take any suggestions!</p>

			 <p><img src="https://numericcitizen-test.micro.blog/uploads/2023/a24a99b754.png" alt="Thumbnails of my produced YouTube videos" title="Thumbnails of my produced YouTube videos"></p>
<p>A year ago, I shared my first YouTube video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos">my YouTube channel</a>. My initial goal was to share videos about using <strong>Craft</strong>, but later came videos about using <strong>Micro.blog</strong>. Here are some notable facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>52 videos about Craft were produced;</li>
<li>5 videos about Micro.blog were produced;</li>
<li>All videos totalling more than 13.5 hours of watch time;</li>
<li>My YouTube channel has 813 subscribers as of now;</li>
<li>Two subscribers gave me money as a sign of appreciation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel I’m now on par with all the things I wanted to talk about regarding Craft. Future Craft videos will touch on new features and tweaked workflow. I still have much work to do for Micro.blog video series, though.</p>
<p>At the initial pace of new subscribers, I set the goal of hitting a thousand subscribers in the first year, but I’m sad to report that I won’t make it. The pace of new subscribers has slowed quite a bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen-test.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f56e1ad564.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This video production journey is full of learning and lessons. Over time, I settled on a production style I’m happy with. I finally found a way to get better sound quality. I recently added iA Presenter to get cue cards showing on my screen while recording (read “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/ia-presenter-a-different-clever-take-at-presentation-software/">iA Presenter — A Different &amp; Clever Take at Presentation Software</a>”). My workflow is stable now and is supported by <a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/youtube-video-production-template">this Craft template</a> (you can download and use it if you are a Craft user, BTW). Finally, I started using <strong>Play.app</strong> to gather all my video links in one place. This provides a quick way to refer to past videos whenever needed.</p>
<p>I also produced videos about other apps like <strong>Capacities</strong>, <strong>Inoreader</strong> and <strong>Anybox</strong>. Some of these videos take the form of a 60 minutes session with the app as a first-time user. It’s fun as there is no script supporting those experiences.</p>
<p>Today, I will record a video about the WWDC 23 conference. The video will complement my recently published <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/apples-wwdc-2023-keynote-thoughts-before-the-news-flood/">article</a> on the same subject. It will be my first foray into tech news and commentary. I’m not planning to do many of these, but WWDC is significant and needs some of my production time attention.</p>

			 <p>So, apparently, just like Twitter, Reddit is entering into a &ldquo;kill-third-party-apps&rdquo; by charging an enormous amount of money to use their APIs. It looks like it. Apollo isn&rsquo;t happy, and for good reasons. Unless there was a calculation error from the makers of Apollo, it just makes no sense for them to continue. Maybe Reddit made some calculation errors, too. Perhaps they fail to read the room&rsquo;s temperature. But maybe they are entitled, to some degree, I guess, to charge for their APIs, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to make a parallel with Apple&rsquo;s dreaded 15%-30% App Store commission. Is Apple&rsquo;s stance on its App Store different from Reddit&rsquo;s stance on its APIs? Is charging a commission to be on the App Store and take advantage of all Apple&rsquo;s technology to get a chance to be distributed on hundreds of millions of iPhones similar to consuming a platform APIs? If not, what is different, actually? Is free API usage a dead end in today&rsquo;s world? There are whole business models built around APIs these days. API speaks intellectual property in my book. Only companies with business models supported by massive ad distribution or expansive paid subscriptions can think of thriving by giving away their API access. It will be interesting to see how Reddit is reacting to third-party developers&rsquo; pushback.</p>
<p>Oh, and if they actually kill the third-party Reddit client ecosystem, unlike Twitter, Reddit platform alternatives are not obvious to me.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s time to remember: there is no such thing as a free lunch.</p>

			 <p>I’m thinking: The <strong>Mac Pro</strong> is expected to feature the same design as its predecessor and the M2 Ultra chip. I have doubts on this. The design was highly influenced by the need of air flow that was driven in part by Intel processors, a power hungry monster. With Apple Silicon, I would expect Apple to tweak the design to reflect the lower power consumption and heat dissipation by the chip.</p>

			 <p><strong>YouTube</strong> reminds me every day why I hate algorithmic timelines. Suppose I open up YouTube and click on one video about long-range airplanes. The minute I&rsquo;m done watching the video, my timeline becomes full of airplane-related videos. YouTube completely washes out my timeline with what the algorithm was programmed to show me based on my consumption behaviours (and probably based on some other weird and highly questionable factors). I hate it. One video and boom, my YouTube universe flips elsewhere. Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m a paying subscriber so I never see an ad. This behaviour is infuriating.</p>

<p>What an intense morning.</p>
<p>I learned about the existence of <a href="https://www.itelescope.net">iTelescope</a>, thanks to <a href="https://www.curtisfamily.org.uk/science/astronomy/the-jewel-box/">this blog post</a> from Christopher Curtis, a service where you can rent astronomical observation time from the comfort of your home.</p>
<p>I read about the Eternal Recurrence, thanks to a post from <a href="https://www.gr36.com/2023/05/25/it-all-led.html">Gr36</a>. I would be ok with the idea of reliving my life as is. Over and over again.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://tidbits.com/2023/01/27/is-your-future-distributed-welcome-to-the-fediverse/">this superb article about Fediverse</a> from Glenn Fleishman for Tidbits, I learned that we could follow anyone on Mastodon using an RSS feed, which we could do with Twitter. I’ll be able to re-add accounts to Inoreader to get news in one place, just as I was doing when I was on Twitter. Cool.</p>
<p>All this because I was searching for ideas to write a few linkposts. I wrote none except this post, but I learned quite a lot. I updated <a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/digitalgarden">my Digital Garden</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://om.co/2023/05/15/the-future-of-fast-food/">reported by Om Malik</a>, automation is the next evolution step for fast food chains. Should I care?</p>
<p>Am I missing anything? I think so, and this is where <a href="https://www.rewind.ai">Rewind</a> could help me a lot.</p>
<p>What about your morning?</p>

			 <p>I had a discussion about AI yesterday with my wife. She came back from a two-day conference in Toronto. One of the sessions was about the place of AI in society and how it is time to engage in promoting and organizing some AI regulations.</p>
<p>The more I read and learn about AI capabilities as exposed in tools like ChatGPT, the more I think we will eventually need some regulation. For example, one thing we discussed (and on which we couldn’t agree) is the introduction of a delay in AI training. What I’d like to see is that AI companies are imposed a 2 or 3 years delay for their model training. And why would this be necessary? How would it change the game?</p>
<p>Remember that current training is lagging simply because we lack the processing power to digest all the digital information produced daily. But, eventually, it will come, just like Google replaced Yahoo when index content was initially entered manually by a group of people and then by a community. Sooner or later, ChatGPT or similar tools will digest the web in near real-time. And this is where this is going to be even more scary and could really get out of control.</p>
<p>Imposing delay on models training would help public knowledge and content to settle down and let consensus emerge in any research field, for example. Short-term noise would be reduced. In my opinion, it would be more challenging for ChatGPT to be infected by bad actors who will eventually try to influence results with toxic data.</p>
<p>My wife and I couldn’t agree on the effectiveness of this simple measure. She thinks that it would make ChatGPT useless or less relevant. My take goes the opposite side where, like in real life, things like encyclopedias are still helpful even though they were written and got frozen as soon as they were printed. So there is a need for them, like there is a need for more dynamic knowledge content like Wikipedia.</p>
<p>More than ever, we need to define what makes us unique, how we protect how uniqueness and consider slowing things down a bit, so we can have more time to understand what is going on and where things could go if we let things go without proper framing.</p>

			 <p>My goal when I started doing YouTube videos about Craft (and now Micro.blog) was to reach a thousand subscribers during the first year. At the current rate, I won&rsquo;t make it. Am I sad about this? No. Is it nagging me? Yes. Why?</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of Craft users out there, and I think they could benefit from watching a few of my videos. That&rsquo;s the whole purpose and &ldquo;raison d&rsquo;être&rdquo; for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos">my YouTube channel</a> which was (and still is) to help users get better at using Craft or learning about Craft if they are not currently using it. Is my absence from Twitter to promote my content making any difference? Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m more inclined and attracted by the idea of testing (and actually using) FCP on iPad than the Mac version. Without being an iMovie on steroids (something that I don&rsquo;t want), I wish FCP for iPad to be a simpler (but not simplistic) version of FCP on the Mac.</p>
<p>The problem: all my videos are all done with Screenflow for Mac because It&rsquo;s all about Mac screen recording. What value would bring another app like FCP for the iPad? I see a more complex workflow because I would need to &ldquo;export&rdquo; from Mac then import into FCP on iPad then do the actual montage on a less capable device (two different device paradigms, little added value).</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>PS: My 2018 iPad Pro isn&rsquo;t capable enough for my 4K screen recordings. But let&rsquo;s imagine that I&rsquo;m on an M1 or M2 iPad Pro.</p>

Sometimes, I look too far to find the perfect solution when there is one in front of my eyes: <a href="https://stories.numericcitizen.photos">Exposure</a>. I&rsquo;m already paying for a subscription! My next photo journal will be created on Exposure.</p>

			 <p>Last year, I went to Italy for my three-week summer vacation. What a trip it was. I built <a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/italy2022">this travel journal with Craft</a> to test Craft&rsquo;s limitations. I concluded that Craft is great for building beautiful documents (and small websites), but for serious photography work: it’s far from perfect and needs big improvements. Can you imagine that nine months later, after so many releases, no single Craft release addressed any of my feedback? None!!! I’m going to Morocco in June. I guess I’ll look elsewhere for sharing a travel journal.</p>

			 <p>I recently heard the notion of blogging for ourselves as opposed to writing for other people to read. I like this idea a lot, and after giving it some thought, I think I know why. If I’m being honest with myself in life and decide to share something like a thought about something, my guess is that writing for ourselves helps a lot in being authentic. I think it’s one of the best ways to attract attention and, eventually, maybe, make a connection.</p>

<p>I re-watched <a href="https://youtu.be/Exco_rEWwkc">the video</a>, where Steve Jobs is touring the very first Apple Store. It&rsquo;s fascinating to see how things evolved over time. Software titles disappeared from shelves, thanks to the App Store. It&rsquo;s no longer possible to put all Apple products on a single table. Macs, iPads, iPhones, watches, HomePod, and device cases took over the place and then more. Thankfully, the Genius bar is still there in many stores because, you know, people still have questions and broken devices to get fixed.</p>

			 <p>A recent report on Apple&rsquo;s upcoming headset:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Key figures including software chief Craig Federighi have also kept their distance from the headset during its development and have seemed wary of it. Apple&rsquo;s senior vice president for hardware technologies, Johny Srouji, is believed to privately be a skeptic of the device, comparing it to a science project. He has warned that designing the high-performance chips that the headset requires could distract from new iPhone chips that drive more revenue.

</blockquote>
<p>Everything will be fine, right? If Mr. Srouji is skeptical because the current product is too far from the original vision, I wouldn&rsquo;t call this alarming. But overall, the signals coming out of these reports aren&rsquo;t encouraging either. Is Apple headed in a bad direction?</p>

<p>15% of new iPhone owners report having an Android device as their last smartphone. That’s a 4% increase from what CIRP saw last year, and 5% higher than the data seen in 2020 and 2021.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The last time new Android switchers made up 15% of new iPhone buyers – according to CIRP – was back in 2018. The highest rate of switchers in the last nine years was 21% back in 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The market is full of previously-owned iPhones for sale. You can find used iPhones from 2 to 3 years ago at reasonable prices these days. People who were using an Android phone probably can now afford to buy an iPhone much cheaper than a brand-new one. Moreover, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/5824/ios-iphone-compatibility/">this chart</a>, iPhones from the last few years can still run the latest releases of iOS with most of the features available. It&rsquo;s very tempting for switchers. This is how I would explain this phenomenon. The study covers the US market. The dynamics might be different in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>One question: what percentage of iPhone owners who buy a new iPhone are returning their iPhone to Apple to get a credit instead of selling their iPhone themselves?</p>

<p>Currently using Photomator for a small project. I love this piece of software. I bought it for 99CAN$ for a lifetime purchase. I prefer Photomator design in general when editing a photo. It’s more approachable to me. Editing with masks is super easy to use, and it creates great results. The Mac version was the one last piece of the puzzle missing. Now we get the full picture (pun intended).</p>
<p>It makes me wonder if I will ever get out of the Adobe subscription trap. The one missing piece from Photomator is the library management. I cannot rely on iCloud Photos Library for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/ed3e418b9e.png" alt=""></p>

<p>First, Personal Voice is incredible! I can’t wait to try this out. I always feared being diagnosed with ALS, but I can see this new accessibility feature, coupled with Live Speech real game changer for people with ALS.</p>
<p>Second, looking at some user interface samples, especially the iPhone with iMessage (see below), we can see the return of shadows, depth, and better contrast, compared to what we have now. So my question is: why not have these UI traits everywhere instead?</p>

			 <p>This weekend, I will publish a 6000 words thousand article about my migration to <strong>Inoreader</strong>. I&rsquo;ve been working on that one for at least three months. While doing so, for the first time, I used Ulysses&rsquo; &ldquo;multi-sheets&rdquo; feature, where each sheet is a different section tied together as a long article that I can publish as a whole. Pretty handy stuff when working on very long articles. Thanks to Ghost&rsquo;s publishing feature, it will also be the first time that a portion of my article (the last three sections) will be made available to my subscribers only.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to share with my readers the long journey that led me to <strong>Inoreder</strong>. Watch <a href="https://numericcitizen.me">this space</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the sort of empowering interaction I love to experience with these new technologies: I’m not being replaced, I’m getting help, much in the way spellcheck and grammar checks in word processors have been doing for decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting parallel here with spell checkers and generative AI. At what point the help we&rsquo;re getting becomes troubling or questionable? The same goes in real life. Suppose there is something that needs your attention in your house, and a fix is required. Either you know from the get-go what to do and fix it yourself, either you go o YouTube and find a visual guide on how to fix it, or you call someone to your house to fix it for you. What&rsquo;s wrong with the latter approach?</p>
<p>If there is something that generative AI brings to the table is the inevitable discussion in society of what is the human touch and when is asking for help crosses the lines and what those lines are.</p>

			 <p>It’s been quite a while since I visited an Apple Store. Last I went for a quick stop after work since I was working at my downtown offices.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/0f4a0a1279.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are soooo many iPad models to choose from! Too many? The 12.9-inch iPad Pro screen is unbelievably gorgeous!! I wish it would come to the 11-inch version. Maybe next year?</p>
<p>Of all the iPad models that I looked at, Stage Manager is not enabled. So what’s up, Apple, with that? Isn’t the Stage Manager good enough for the showroom?</p>
<p>I wish I had bought the Studio Display with the articulated arm. Expensive but give the most flexibility. Too bad it’s not possible to replace the monitor’s stand.</p>
<p>I tested the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air and tried to imagine what a 15-inch version would be. Not an easy thing to do. Speaking of MacBook, when I looked around on the MacBook table, they all look about the same; only the thickness makes it look slightly different, oh and the “colors”.</p>
<p>I love the latest version of the iPhone display stands. Less dangling wires. Easy to grab and put back in place.</p>

<p>In the previous image, I am holding the iPhone 14 Pro Max. I was still testing the device’s overall size. This is my next. I mean, the 15 Pro Max (Ultra?).</p>
<p>It was the day Apple released their FY2023 Q2 results. The store was unusually quiet. The illuminated decorations on the walls are getting old. I never really liked them.</p>
<p>I’m out after having spent twenty minutes there.</p>

			 <p>I had such a busy creative weekend, to the point where I wonder if I did too much. I mean, I didn’t see most of the weekend. It was raining most of the time, and I had those videos and articles that I wanted to move forward. On the positive side, I feel that my ideas backlog is more than ever in control.</p>

			 <p>I’m still wondering where I’ll spend my Sunday afternoon for my creative activities. Should I go out to a coffee shop near my house or should I stay home, make myself a coffee and go in my home office? 🤔🙄</p>
<p>I like the ambiance of the coffee shops, looking around me and furtively watching some people in their own bubble, in front of their screen, with their AirPods on, typing, pausing, etc. It’s a stimulating environment.</p>

<p>Grammarly just enabled Grammarly Go on my account. I think that’s cool and could prove to be handy occasionally. Grammarly isn’t perfect, far from it, but for someone like me who’s not an English native, it helps a lot. Now, with Go, I feel even more in good company for all my writing. I get 500 requests per month with my subscription, which is way more than enough. Are any Grammarly users out there?</p>

<p>Here’s my take on this. It’s straightforward: you don’t need to be verified by Twitter (or any of these centralizing platforms) to feel that you exist, are relevant and be fabulous! Just be. If you’re uncomfortable with recently introduced changes at Twitter, move on elsewhere. That is all.</p>
<p>I’m fed up with these stories about Twitter removing previously verified check marks! This is stupid. It was bound to bound to fail from the start. Now, here we are. It failed. Look ahead.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/my-life-after-twitter-reflections-on-a-more-peaceful-digital-landscape/">Friday Notes edition #102</a>, I shared my thoughts about my last four months without Twitter and how calm and quiet my digital life has become. I even wrote that I might ignore Bluesky. But that was last week.</p>
<p>Well, it didn’t take long to contradict myself! As you might have guessed, I’m now on Bluesky as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/numericcitizen.me">@numericcitizen</a> (of course), thanks to a generous donator of an invite link (looking at you <a href="https://micro.blog/Maique">@Maique</a>).</p>
<p>Please make no mistake; it’s an experiment. I’m not planning to spend too much time on Bluesky, but I’m genuinely curious about its evolution and the traction it gets, if any.</p>
<p>I’m allowing myself to get on board for a simple reason: Manton from Micro.blog added support for cross-posting content to Bluesky. It didn’t take long. For me, it’s like getting a seal of approval from him. I highly value his opinion on Bluesky and the open web in general. So, I made the jump without really knowing what to do next except to enable the cross-posting of my content posted on MB.</p>
<p>Now, I wish Bluesky doesn’t get filled up with too many dark clouds. My fingers are crossed.</p>
<p>PS. I’m curious how Micro.blog will push that post onto the Bluesky universe. See you on the other side.</p>
<p>PPS. I’m gathering my thoughts and observations for an upcoming experiment status report. Stay tuned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the day Russia launched its invasion Feb. 24, Amazon has been working closely with the Ukrainian government to download essential data and ferry it out of the country in suitcase-sized solid-state computer storage units called Snowball Edge, then funnelling the data into Amazon’s cloud computing system.</p>

<p>As a guy working in IT for nearly 30 years, I can imagine how complex and critical this project was for Ukraine. Transferring a vast amount of data doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. Preparing a landing zone in a cloud provider is a complex project. AWS&rsquo;s (Amazon) contribution is essential, and I wonder if their contribution covers the subscription fees too.

			 <p>As reported by the Wall Street Journal (since it’s paywalled, look at MacRumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/21/apple-launching-journaling-app/">report</a> instead), Apple is supposedly working on its own journaling application. Code named « Jurassic », many interesting details are emerging from this report.</p>
<p>As an avid user of Dayone (read « <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/documenting-your-numeric-life/">Documenting My Numeric Life With Dayone</a> »). , I find the prospect of having Apple entering the journaling apps landscape quite exciting. The idea of using journaling to help users with mental health issues is pretty clever. There is so much information available on our devices from which, I guess, we can infer some mental states. I’m guessing machine learning can be of some tremendous help here. Coupled with Apple’s stance on privacy, this provides a potentially very compelling story for a lot of people. Me included. Yet, some people could find this move to be crossing a line that is not acceptable for them. We will see.</p>
<p>The WSJ story is referring to very specific detailed aspects of the rumoured app. For example, journaling suggestions would be based on call history and iMessage conversations, and be ephemeral. After four week they would vanish from suggestions. I’m guessing this would help automate some aspects of daily journaling.</p>
<p>I asked this question to ChatGPT: « _Is the young generation into journal as much as older generations? _». Here is what it has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_ There is no definitive answer to this question, as attitudes towards journaling can vary widely among individuals of all ages. However, some studies suggest that younger generations may be more likely to engage in forms of expressive writing such as blogging or social media updates, which could be seen as a form of journaling._</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debate might still be out if the youngsters generation is very into the writing journey, but having some part of the journaling automated would alleviate some rebarbative aspects of maintaining a journal.</p>
<p>Can you imagine having the journal app assembling photos, messages, phone calls, geo locations into pre populated journaling suggestions? Wow. I’m really looking forward into that one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the leaker also claimed that the &ldquo;Action&rdquo; button will replace the volume up button for taking photos in the Camera app, with force-sensitivity enabling a light press to auto-focus the camera, a hard press to take a picture, and a hard/long press to record video.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, this is a rumour, but it&rsquo;s an interesting one. If Apple does this, it would bring the iPhone 15 Pro / Max closer to traditional camera behaviour. Coupled with the upgraded cameras and possible addition of the periscope lens, Apple seems geared to make the next iPhone iteration another potential winner.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been following the war in Ukraine on a daily basis since the very beginning. It’s an enduring journey, to say the least. Imanyo has many sad and ugly stories and so many images from this conflict. Some of them are powerful symbols of any war&rsquo;s ugly side. What I should have done was to collect images so I can remember what Ukrainians went (and are still) going through. Historic moments are being played right before our eyes; we should pay attention as they will define the next decades of international relations.</p>

			 <p>As <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/brazil-says-ukraine-should-cede-crimea-to-russia-to-end-war-kyiv-says-no/">reported by The Kyiv Independent</a>, Brazil’s proposal to get a peaceful resolution between Russia and Ukraine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva suggested that Ukraine should be open to the idea of giving up Crimea in exchange for peace with Russia.” — Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. That’s quite a suggestion. How can a sound man be so sure and trust Russia to bring peace by giving up a piece of land? Who do they think Putin’s Russia is? They already had Crimea, for god’s sake!!! It didn’t stop them from invading the rest of the country! Putin and Russia cannot be trusted, now and in the future. I find this proposal utterly irresponsible and lacking any sense of realism. What a clown.</p>

<p>I was looking for inspiration all week to write my next <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/tag/friday-notes-series/">Friday Notes</a> edition. Early morning yesterday, I was still unsure if I could make it, but at lunchtime, I tried ChatGPT with “Give me some blog post ideas about the positive effects on creativity of going on vacation for a week”. It came back with phrases that looked taken from a travel agency ad. I tried again with different variations of my question. It failed to impress and to inspire me. I’ll pass this week’s edition.</p>

<p>I’m currently testing <strong>Little Snitch mini</strong>. I had the <strong>Little Snitch</strong> app on my radar for a while, but this week they released what could be a better &amp; lighter solution for me. The problem? As an IT guy, I like to know what is happening in my machines, and this little piece of well-crafted software could be the answer. So far, I really like what I’m seeing. It makes me think of <strong>Flighty</strong> from a visual design perspective. It could replace a portion of Stats, an open-source replacement for iStats Menu. I’ll decide once I’m back from vacation.</p>

			 <p>My wife recently told me how she was looking and considering tools like ChatGPT in her work. She considers ChatGPT like having an intern working with her. The intern will do the work she asks, but she knows she will have to give it a critical eye on the results just in case any errors creep in. If using interns in companies, why is ChatGPT not considered at the same level? Open for debate.</p>
<p>I like this intern analogy.</p>

<p>I’m late in my readings. I’m not sure what to think of this weird take about the iPad and Mac future from Jason Snell.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1658491/mac-ipad-pro-future.html">The key to the Mac&rsquo;s survival isn&rsquo;t a new Air–it&rsquo;s the next iPad Pro</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would it be such a cataclysm if I could simply reboot that iPad into macOS or run macOS inside a virtual machine?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it would be. What a weird idea. I’m nearly baffled by this article. How many of these ideas and requests are age-dependent? How does the younger generation view those perceived limitations of the iPad or the Mac?</p>
<p>For us who have experienced both computing paradigms, it is tempting to ask for one paradigm to borrow some of the other paradigm traits. Does it make them better? I’m resigned and unexcited to the prospect of getting the touch screen trait on the Mac, but having to reboot an iPad to get the Mac experience is ludicrous, IMO.</p>

<p>Even if Apple releases a HomePod with a screen in a form of a “iPad-like” device, I don’t see them beating <strong>Nixplay</strong> digital photo frames anythine soon. I recently got one for my home office and I’m really impressed with this very focused product. From the unboxing, to the frame setup and to the moment of my first uploaded photos started displaying on it, it was a great user experience. Very Apple-like.</p>

<p><strong>What do you use for a mobile note taking app (does it sync with your computer)? — Alan H</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am very low-tech when it comes to note taking. I use the default iOS/MacOS Notes app for most things, including keeping track of my media diet. It&rsquo;s simple, works pretty well, can handle to-do lists, and syncs seamlessly with all of my devices.</p>

<p>I’ve invested so much of my time into <strong>Craft</strong>, since I left <strong>Notion</strong>. I never really left Notion, actually, but my usage of this app dramatically dropped. Only a few very limited use cases were left under the Notion umbrella. Today, I tried something in Notion for a project at work. I’m blown away to see how Craft is so far behind compared to Notion for things like databases, integration via APIs and general flexibility.</p>
<p>Sure, Notion has been around for much longer. Yet, I secretly wish I could use the best of both worlds: the elegance of Craft built on top of the robust Notion foundation. I’m actively looking at use cases that I could do in Notion to keep it alive somewhere in my workflow.</p>

			 <p>Apple, please do a real but simple password manager. I join my voice to many, like <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/27/apple-passwords-deserve-an-app">John Gruber</a> and <a href="https://cabel.com/2023/03/27/apple-passwords-deserve-an-app/">Cabel Sasser</a>. I even suggested <a href="https://micro.blog/rmondello@hachyderm.io">Ricky Mondello</a> who’s working on the Safari team and very much involved in the password management side, to consider doing such a password manager outside of Safari on the Mac or Settings on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Is Apple refraining from doing so because they see the future as passwordless, thanks to passkeys? Probably but it is a long road to get there, so what do we do in the meantime? As Gruber said, password management is probably as important as tips about using your iPhone, which has its own app on the home screen.</p>

<p>After reading Gruber’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/wavelength">article</a> about <strong>Wavelength</strong>, I decided to try it. I’m not sure I require another messaging solution. Besides using Apple’s iMessage and Telegram to get news from Ukraine, the rest of my messaging app usage is anecdotic.</p>
<p>So, what are my thoughts about this? The initial few moments with Wavelength are not what I call an honest onboarding experience. Well, I already <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/03/28/for-those-who.html">shared my surprise</a> at having to enter my phone number at the very first step of the application onboarding. I thought it was brutal. I was quickly reminded that asking for our phone number is the usual thing to ask in a messaging app. M’ok. 🤨 But hey, Wavelength is still in beta, right? So, let’s give them a break.</p>
<p>So I created a group called <strong>Microbloggers</strong> (<a href="https://wavelength.app/invite/K8vZnQI51dy#M3iTwlw1LzkPjaBFp8UZGw--">invite link</a>) for hosting people coming from Micro.blog (well, anyone with the link can join). As I’m writing this, there are 25 members. I’m surprised. I wasn’t expecting that many people to join. I guess my Micro.blog circle is made of very curious people. I love this. Is <a href="https://micro.blog/Manton">@Manton</a> joining? Nope. But <a href="https://micro.blog/Jean">@Jean</a> is among the participant, which I find cool!</p>
<p>My general feeling with the application is that its design reminds me of Micro.blog’s simplicity. Wavelength is simple but not simplistic. I love it very much. I’m using Wavelength mainly on the Mac, but also on the iPhone. I prefer the Mac experience. But, again, Wavelength is not complete. I’m looking forward to watching its future evolution.</p>
<p>An interesting byproduct of Wavelength is the inclusion of a ChatGPT client inside. It’s the group called “AI”. We can interact with it at any given time, even include this “guy” in a conversation within a group, using the <a href="https://micro.blog/AI">@AI</a> in a message. Each request to the AI entity is kept as an individual conversation (except the one occurring within a group conversation). It’s fun, valuable and fascinating at the same time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/6b73915b46.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But now, the big question: why would someone of Micro.blog starts using Wavelength and participates in a group chat? Conversations are already happening on Micro.blog. Just like on Micro.blog, if you are a member of a Wavelength group, conversations are public. I’m still pondering this. I understand people who are also wondering about the usefulness of having Wavelength alongside the Micro.blog. Maybe the instant nature of such messaging platform is something missing on Micro.blog? This is something I liked on Twitter: this ability to enter a private conversation with one of your followers.</p>
<p>Well, that’s it for now.</p>
<p>You can join the “Microbloggers” Wavelength group with this <a href="https://wavelength.app/invite/K8vZnQI51dy#M3iTwlw1LzkPjaBFp8UZGw--">invite link</a>. I plan to leave the group open as long as my experiment with Wavelength lasts.</p>
<p>One last thing: after launching the app for the first time, this wave animation is mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Another thing: my avatar photo is me at 5. 😊</p>

			 <p>Why a dedicated music app for Apple Music Classical? When we first learned that Apple would launch a different app for Apple Music Classical, I was surprised and wondered why not add a big tile in its current Apple Music app. Apple explains this in more detail <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213415">here</a> about the reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classical music is different. It has longer and more detailed titles, multiple artists for each work, and hundreds of recordings of well-known pieces. The Apple Music Classical app is designed to support the complex data structure of classical music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get it. It makes sense. Now, here is another question: could there be a need to create more “genre-dedicated” apps offering different browsing and listening experiences? How much could an app be different for electronic music? How about creating an app dedicated to music videos? All of these apps could tap the Apple Music back end. This needs more time to think about.</p>
<p>Oh, no iPad app, at launch, really?</p>

<p>Time to update all my devices. There are many.🙃 I’m always impressed by how effective Apple can be to keep the beat going on and on for releasing so much new software all at once. If you’ve been in software development, you probably already know this is a major undertaking, each, and single time. Kudos to Apple.</p>

			 <p>This morning, I had a heated (and respectful) debate about ChatGPT, what artificial intelligence is, what defines human intelligence, and why I believe we may be on a dangerous slope. We’re far from done with all of this. We need to define a new word to describe what is produced by ChatGPT-like bots. I think the problem stems from the fact that the “brute force” approach used by such tools makes it look intelligent for the mortal who doesn’t understand anything about computers. There is a clear distinction in my mind between what humans can produce and what ChatGPT can produce. The background behind the process is as much important to me as the actual results. Otherwise, we are doomed.</p>

<p>The former was my WordPress site, now on Ghost and merged with what used to be the <strong>Numeric Citizen Introspection</strong>, the home for my Friday Notes Series newsletter. It took me a while, but here I am. I’m so relieved from not having to use WordPress anymore. I have learned quite a bit about WordPress since 2015, but my desire to simplify my digital life was pressing me to make some changes.</p>
<p>From now on, in Ulysses, I got two places to push my articles, here or Ghost. That’s it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/cc8a1647d6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Both are under the same domain name, which is something that I wanted for a while. Now, I hope to spend more time writing than moving things around. I will publish my migration process in the upcoming days on my <a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/meta">Numeric Citizen I/O</a>, my metablog.</p>
<p>From a design perspective, I’m using Ghost’s Casper default theme, which is relatively close to what I was using on WordPress. I’m ok with this for the moment. I may hunt for alternatives in the future, but for now, that will be it.</p>
<p>Now, returning to normal programming.</p>

			 <p>Moving out of WordPress is such a pain. It was a pain to be there. It is a pain to get out of it. My problem: I’m moving to Ghost. I need to use their plugin, but the resulting files will get ingested in Ghost with a format that I don’t like. Each post will be inside an HTML object instead of a native Ghost post. That, I don’t like. Thinking of exporting content using WordPress export option and then translating it to Markdown. But Ghost doesn’t support Markdown files import. I could republish each post using Ulysses for example. But I cannot back-date any post when publishing.</p>

			 <p>Craft version 2.4.5 came out today after more than six weeks since the previous release. Usually, releases come out every two to three weeks. I guess people’s expectations were pretty high after having waited so long.</p>
<p>Not only did the update bring very limited functionality, it broke a seemingly simple gesture that was used by a majority of users, mostly on the iPhone. As you might expect, this caused plenty of pushbacks on this. My guess is that it took the Craft team by surprise. Moreover, a new navigation sidebar design is also causing a some more pushback.</p>
<p>There is a recurring theme on Slack that people are tired of waiting for basic fixes while receiving questionable features they don’t see useful in general, not only for them. It’s a bit of a public relation crisis. Now my question, could this crisis be prevented? My short answer is yes. I gave a longer answer in my recent YouTube video&hellip; “<a href="https://youtu.be/KQ4hhxD9-D4">A Proposal for Handling Users Feedback Differently</a>” and published <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/PDGHBuQthSwPSl">an article</a> too.</p>
<p>Craft is a young company. They have plenty of things to learn, and managing expectations is certainly one of them. Managing or at the very least communicating a clear roadmap is another. It’s not enough to publish an article once a year on the company’s blog. Such messages need repetitive reminders and on more than one platform. If they would rather not share a roadmap, then they should probably stop using Slack and Circle. Those are discussion platforms where feedback and feature requests are expressed, albeit in a chaotic way.</p>
<p>What I’m starting to find really troubling and worrisome is the lack of fixes to obvious issues affecting many users, me included. And we are talking about long-standing issues here. Slack is full of users expressing their resentment for unfixed problems. Sure we get answers like “we’re on it”, “will check this out, thanks for the report”, “bla bla bla”. Actions speak louder than words. For the first time since I’m using Craft, I’m starting to wonder if I should reconsider my posture with my dependency on Craft.</p>

			 <p>I recently discovered two new apps that are now in <a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/meta-toolset">my documented toolset</a>: <strong>Anybox</strong> and <strong>Zavala</strong>. Both apps have something in common: the ability to copy a deeplink to an object like a collection or a document. For example, in Anybox, I select a collection and use the &ldquo;Copy Link&rdquo; option. In Zavala, I select a document and use the &ldquo;Copy Document Link&rdquo; option. Then, I can use these links in Craft. Here is an example: <em>anybox://collection/2340CA48-16BC-4F33-AFFA-6323FEB6605A</em>. When in Craft, clicking such a link will open the app with the target object in focus and selected. It&rsquo;s super useful as those apps taken together form a powerful combination.</p>

<p>I dislike the concept of editing old content on personal sites. And the motivation is related to my love for simple, straight to the point, chronologically organised personal blogs. I believe a personal blog can and should be a representation of who you are at different points in time. We change, we grow and our thoughts and ideas grow and change with us. And it&rsquo;s important to have testament of that. If I change my mind on something and I go back end edit my post from 4 years ago, there&rsquo;s no way for you to see and be aware of that change. And that&rsquo;s a shame. Source: <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts-on-an-unpolished-note">Thoughts on an unpolished note – Manu</a></p>

<p>This post made me think about the process I&rsquo;m currently going through with my move from WordPress to Ghost. I&rsquo;m deleting old content. In fact, as of today, I deleted about 60% of my old posts. Why? Because I feel that many posts are too time-sensitive to make sense today. They have little value to me now (and probably for the rest of the planet). I decided to keep only worthy articles that can endure the passing of time and stay relevant. My blog here, the &ldquo;blog.&rdquo; part of blog.numericcitizen.me better fits this purpose of expressing all sort of more or less worthy thoughts. There, I don&rsquo;t care too much. And this is where I&rsquo;m with Manuel. It&rsquo;s all about sharing &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo;. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how great some of Microsoft&rsquo;s promotional videos are in regards to Office and Windows user interface. But why, in actual usage, does Microsoft products&rsquo; UI suck anyway? We never seem to get the UI that Microsoft is presenting in their videos. Office doesn&rsquo;t look like that at all. Windows doesn&rsquo;t either.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://kottke.org/23/03/kottke-is-25-years-old-today">Kottke.org turns 25</a>. It’s quite a remarkable journey. I didn’t know about this website until recently. I’m not a frequent reader of it, although I spent quite some time today on it to better get the gist of it. Yet, I’m barely sure how to pronounce it. But I’m quite impressed to see someone’s life spent running a blog and getting paid for it.</p>
<p>I’ve been into computer tech since I was a teenager. I’m 55 now. I learned quite a lot from writing software, doing digital photography, followed Apple’s story with avid attention. My creativity is at its best with computers. I even found my career by simply being exposed to computers.</p>
<p>For some reason, I didn’t know much about website hosting back then, even less about blogs. I didn’t pay attention, I guess. It’s like being a writer who didn’t know we could write books. This sounds strange.</p>
<p>I wish I had a blog for this long. It’s not the first time that I have written this thought. But Kottke.org turning 25 reminds me that I wish I were this guy. Can you imagine having written 40 000 posts? I don’t know if we can still read them all (<a href="https://kottke.org/everfresh">it appears we can</a>). You won’t find all my posted content since I first wrote my first post. And I keep deleting stuff while moving from one place to another because I think it makes no sense to keep all that.</p>
<p>Bravo to Kottke.org.</p>

<p>Personally, I think this year is too early for ARM-based Mac. Why? Because, my thinking is that Apple wants iOS on these ARM-Based Macs, not Mac. And they want a lot of ready-to-use, yet well-known apps to be available. For this, they are working on Marzipan (which later became Catalyst) to entice developers to write more powerful apps for iOS, especially the iPad. These are the prime candidates to run on this future ARM-based Mac. We are four weeks away from knowing a bit more about Apple’s strategy.

<p>I can barely remember what I was doing in 2002. I didn&rsquo;t have a website. I didn&rsquo;t know about website hosting. I didn&rsquo;t really care about blogs, for that matter. I started blogging in 2009 when I started doing iPhone application development. I wanted to share my discoveries while learning Objective-C and publishing apps on the App Store.

			 <p>Riccardo Mori wrote an interesting take about the possible future of the Mac with a touch screen <a href="https://morrick.me/archives/9715">Why do you want to touch your Mac screen so badly? | Riccardo Mori</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the people who’d love to have a touchscreen Mac are people who prefer having the iPad and iPhone as primary devices for work and leisure. It’s the iPad-first guys who on the one hand are frustrated by the still mediocre multitasking and still limited functionality Apple is providing on the iPad, and on the other hand realize the sheer versatility and multitasking dexterity the Mac still has in spades despite the general worsening of Mac OS over the past few years. In short, they say they’d love a touchscreen Mac, but what they mean is that they’d love a hybrid iPad/Mac device that could offer the best of both worlds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today at work, during a Zoom call, my colleague found out by error that she could touch the screen of her Windows portable to interact with it. She was totally mesmerized. Then she continued with the conversation. I don&rsquo;t think it will make a big difference in her world. What people want is an iPad when it makes sense, a traditional computer, when it makes sense. Microsoft seems to have found an enduring combo with its Surface.</p>

<p><strong>@numericcitizen@me.dm</strong> is my new Mastodon address on Medium’s newly launched Mastodon instance. It’s without enthusiasm that I created this address when Medium opened the door to all Medium members today. I left the Paid Partner Program earlier this year. First, because I was no longer publishing articles over there. Second, because I’m not at ease supporting a closed platform like Medium. I’m not sure where I’ll go from here. That being said, I find it interesting that a closed and proprietary platform like Medium opens up to Mastodon, a distributed and open source network. Call it opportunistic, it will be interesting to see where this will lead in the future. I’ll certainly watch from afar.</p>

<p>Gurman said it is &ldquo;plausible&rdquo; that at least the next 13-inch MacBook Air will be equipped with the as-yet-unannounced M3 chip, which will reportedly be manufactured based on TSMC&rsquo;s latest 3nm process for improved performance. The current 13-inch model was released in July 2022 and is powered by the M2 chip, which is based on a 5nm process. Source: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/05/new-macbook-airs-by-summer-gurman/">Gurman: New 13-Inch and 15-Inch MacBook Airs Likely to Launch by Summer - MacRumors</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would be really surprised to see the updated MacBook Air product line introduce the new M3 so soon. Why? The MacBook Pro is based on the M2. Even if people buy computers, not chips, it would send a weird signal to have an M3 product at the entry level while the Pro machines are using M2. The 3 nanometer process will probably help reduce heat dissipation, but the last time I checked, the M2 in the 13-inch MacBook Air doesn&rsquo;t exhibit any problems, even when the machine is running at full processing power.</p>
<p>One possibility, though, is if the M3 chip really helps make a difference from an end-user perspective enough to entice users to upgrade. We&rsquo;ll see soon enough. And I can&rsquo;t wait to get my hands on the 15-inch version of the MacBook Air.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s the week-end in a few hours, consider those suggestions by Shawn Blanc: <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2023/02/a-few-alternative-things-you-can-do-when-youre-bored-instead-of-scrolling-social-media/">A few alternative things you can do when you’re bored (instead of scrolling social media)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are a few alternatives to what I call the “Just Checks”.</p>
<p>– Scroll through your <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/whats-day-one-2018-edition/">Day One</a> timeline and read a previous journal entry or browse some old photos and memories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>– Launch Day One and log how you’ve spent your time so far for the day. Doing this for a few weeks can also be super helpful for getting a perspective of where your time and energy are being spent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>– Write down 3 new <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2015/06/you-have-ideas/">ideas</a>. These could be articles you want to write, business ideas, places you want to visit or photograph, topics you want to research, date ideas for you and your spouse, gift ideas for a friend, etc. <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2022/08/feel-free-to-say-no-to-your-own-ideas/">These ideas never have to to be acted on</a> — the point isn’t to generate a to-do list, but rather to exercise your mind and <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/2022/10/how-to-build-your-idea-muscle/">build your idea muscle</a>. Ideation and creativity are muscles, and the more we exercise them the stronger they get.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>– Send a text message to a friend or family member to tell them how awesome they are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>– Don’t get out your phone at all — do some stretches or take a 5-minute walk.</p>

<p>Me? I&rsquo;ll be creating, as always. Have a great weekend.</p>

			 <p>As noted by MacRumors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second beta of iOS 16.4 that was introduced to developers today appears to have a limited number of new features, but it does have a major update for those who use Apple Books - it reintroduces an option for the page-turning animation. Source: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/ios-16-4-apple-books-page-turning-animation/">iOS 16.4 Beta 2 Re-Adds Page Turning Animation to Apple Books - MacRumors</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One quick question: who decided it was a good idea to remove such page-turning animation in the first place? What problem did it solve? Books are still a big part of our life, and this animation is a great reference to the experience of reading a book.</p>

			 <p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with 9to5Mac here: <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/03/02/2018-ipad-pro-2/">There&rsquo;s something special about the 2018 iPad Pro - 9to5Mac</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2018 iPad Pro deserves a prominent spot in the Apple hardware hall-of-fame. No other product from Apple has remained so functional for so long without appearing long in the tooth. The 11-inch iPad Pro, specifically, has held up extraordinarily well for a product from nearly five years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used my iPad Pro quite often and for so many different use cases. During work days, it becomes a second screen next to my Apple Studio Display. At night, it&rsquo;s a content-consuming machine. During the weekend, it&rsquo;s a streaming device while I do some food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s something else special about the 2018 iPad Pro: New features for any given year are often likely to make their way to cheaper versions of the same product given enough time. The 2018 iPad Pro hasn’t had to deal with this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 2018 iPad Pro feels snappy and a very capable device, except when Stage Manager is turned on. It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upgrading from a 2018 iPad Pro would fetch you a LiDAR sensor, an ultra wide camera, 5G compared to LTE, and a modest new Apple Pencil feature with hover.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next year I&rsquo;m pretty sure to upgrade my aging iPad Pro. I&rsquo;ll be looking for the hover capabilities with the Apple Pencil as well as get an upgraded screen quality with OLED.</p>

			 <p>After Anybox <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/02/28/i-want-to.html">earlier this week</a>, now is the turn of <a href="https://timestory.app">TimeStory</a> to make its debut on <a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/meta-toolset">my list of apps under consideration</a>. About TimeStory, from the application&rsquo;s website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TimeStory is a Mac app for illustrating events on a timeline, designed to help you easily create plans and roadmaps, capture history, tell stories, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I spent quite some time today on a project at work using TimeStory. I&rsquo;m blown away by the simplicity and the craftsmanship that went into this app. It&rsquo;s very focused, which makes it easy to learn. At every step of my experimentation with the app, I was met with an evident interaction and response from TimeStory. I built something that took me a few hours instead of days in MS Project. Consider me impressed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the seven-day free trial. I&rsquo;ll probably buy the app for two reasons: it brought me real added value in my workflow, joy, and some rewards along the way. Also, I can see a few use cases in my personal numeric life, for my <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/qwrtsQCOFp2eCH">Apple Rumours hub</a>, for example.</p>
<p>We need more apps like this. Very focused, not trying to impress with undeeded features. On the Mac only. Native: AppKit + Swift. No subscription.</p>
<p>Oh, and I love TimeStory&rsquo;s <a href="https://timestory.app/about/">About page</a>. It&rsquo;s always interesting to learn about the behind-the-scenes story of an app. I hope this app continues to evolve and improve for as long as possible.</p>

			 <p>😅 Moving all my newsletter subscriptions to <strong>Inoreader</strong> (instead of Hey Mail) for a better reading and annotation experience. Unsubscribing to many along the way. That&rsquo;s one of the many benefits of switching to Inoreader. Hey Mail isn&rsquo;t that good for reading newsletters after all, when you compare it to other solutions (including Matter, Readwise Reader, etc.). Substack doesn&rsquo;t make it easy to change the subscription email, BTW. 👨‍💻</p>

			 <p>Massive migration going on right now&hellip; to <strong>Anybox</strong>. I&rsquo;m in love with this little app. Currently moving out my bookmarks from Craft. Next up will be Safari. Thankfully, Anybox can import Safari-exported bookmark files.</p>

			 <p>Another day, another rabbit hole. This time, meet <strong>Anybox</strong>, a bookmark manager for macOS, iOS and iPadOS. I&rsquo;ve been playing with it on macOS and I really like what I&rsquo;m seeing. It&rsquo;s a bit nerdy, but I do like it a lot. Everything I tried or wonder if it could do was met with a &ldquo;ah&rdquo; or &ldquo;ooooh&rdquo;. PopClip integration, easy integration with Things 3, data portability secured (lots of import &amp; export formats), great user interface, Safari extension support. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Now, the only thing is to try to find a real use case for it. I&rsquo;ve been using Craft for the most part for bookmarks collection, so my need for an app like Anybox is still unclear. Stay tuned on that one.</p>
<p>Is this another solution in search of a problem? 🤔</p>

			 <p>Got this for the Apple Studio Display and iPhone 13 Pro. With macOS Ventura Camera Continuity, it works much better than I thought. It works great with Microsoft Teams. Best way to add Center Stage to Microsoft Teams (using the Control Center settings while the camera is on). No latency. Surprising how low the battery power consumption is. It would have been nice if the iPhone mount could also recharge the iPhone, though.</p>

			 <p>For the first time today, I diligently tested Micro.blog’s bookmarking feature. I don’t know if this is a popular feature among MB users, but I wonder if I should find a place for MB bookmarks in my workflow. Let’s see a typical workflow.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/938c3e82dc.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, I start reading an article from my now favourite RSS reader: Inoreader. I decide to open the source website and use the bookmarklet to save the page into MB bookmarks. After a few minutes, MB diligently created a readable article archive stripped of all the noise. Think of it as an MB version of Instapaper.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/1c186c8a33.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I open the newly created archive and start my reading. I find an interesting or very valuable passage that I select in the browser. MB shows a very gentle overlay titled “Highlight”. I click on it, and sure enough, the text gets highlighted. But that’s not all.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/4772dec351.png" alt=""></p>
<p>MB can display a list of all my highlights. If I find a highlight that I want to create a linkpost for, I simply click the “New post” button underneath it. And voilà, I can start writing my linkpost right there.</p>
<p>Moreover, MB offers a simple way to save a bookmark by entering the article’s URL into the provided field at the top of the “Bookmarks” section on the MB website. Very handy.</p>
<p>Bookmarks can be embedded in a blog post too. Just click “Embed” underneath a specific bookmark.</p>
<p>The only downside, for now, is the lack of data portability: bookmarks and highlights can’t be saved or exported outside MB.</p>
<p>The bookmarking feature is part of the Premium subscription tier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We now live in a world of multimodal communications, and how we communicate is changing. The omnipresence of devices in our lives — smartphones to computers, means most of our conversations and communications happen through text. We have replaced so much of our face-to-face interaction with the written word. Teams, Slack and Discords, are part of our daily lives now. As the volume of text in our lives increases, we need tools that help facilitate and perhaps improve how we write and how fast we write.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. tech giant Apple has paid a 906 million rouble ($12.12 million) fine in a Russian antitrust case alleging abuse of its dominance in the mobile apps market, Russia&rsquo;s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) said on Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, where is the money going once paid by Apple? The current situation in Ukraine mandates more scrutiny. Personally, I would have shut down the App Store altogether in this market. Plain and simple as well as give a middle finger instead of paying the fine. But that&rsquo;s me.</p>

			 <p>Dear developers, be honest with us. In my usual morning rabbit hole digging, I stumbled on Flow, a Pomodoro app for the Mac. According to the website, Flow is free.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/5fc3c5d5c6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I click on the “Available on the App Store” link. Once in the App Store, I look at the app details.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/1cba87eaa0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then, things start to look different. There is an “In-app purchases” tag. Scrolling down to the details, I get to see this.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/0254352cc5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, I go up and read the app description. 😠 The developer fooled me. I feel cheated when basic and core features are under the “Pro” plan (like a timer custom duration). It’s a stupid one-feature app, and the developer manages to put the core feature under the pro plan!! I skip the app and move on because I don’t feel the developer is honest in his approach. Yeah, I know it’s called “marketing”.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>👨‍💻 I’ve been extensively testing Inoreader recently and I have to say that as much as I like the service, I find the support for third-party services seriously lacking.</p>
<p>Inoreader supports many third-party services like Blogger, Telegram, Buffer, Evernote, LinkedIn, Hootsuite, Pocket, Google Drive, Instapaper, OneNote, Hatena Bookmarks and Dropbox.</p>
<p>It certainly a long list of services but the problem is that I don’t use any of them. I recently cancelled Buffer and Pocket. I’m surprised to see Blogger but not WordPress or Ghost. Who’s using Hootsuite these days?</p>
<p>I wish Raindrop.io or Notion would be supported, after all, both of these services support offer APIs. Too bad because with better integration often come more efficient workflows.</p>
<p>Building something around tags, IFTTT and RSS could unlock some form of automated workflow. For example, tagging an article would generate an article in a custom RSS feed built using Inoreader which would trigger an applet on IFTTT monitoring this RSS feed which in turn could create an entry in Things 3. The latter part is a challenge, though. IFTTT can’t talk to Things, but it can talk to Google Sheet.</p>
<p>Nothing is perfect I guess. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

			 <p>I’m heading to Micro.blog and start reading on my timeline, I read <a href="https://mastodon.social/@isaiah/109913870576515313">someone’s post</a> about note taking apps, mentioning how Bear Notes is great. I switch to Bear Notes <a href="https://bear.app">website</a>. After watching the introduction video, I head to the website’s blog section. Bear Notes certainly looks great. This particular <a href="https://blog.bear.app/2022/07/exploring-how-bear-can-work-with-other-apps/">blog post</a> looks at how Bear Notes can work with other apps like Things 3 and Readwise. I wonder how I could use Brea Notes for my workflow. I’m reminded that we can export Readwise highlights in markdown files. I head to Readwise website and give it a try. I play with the export options for a while and export all my highlights, more than 1400 in total. Easy and quick. Next I wonder if I could import them in Craft. Yes I can. What about importing them in Ulysses. Yes I could. Then I remember that Ulysses, my go-to writing app, is great. And forget about Bear Notes.</p>

<p>👉🏻 Day One, <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/web/">now available on the web</a>. Woah! This is cool.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of Day One. I use it 99% of time for documenting my numeric life (details <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2018/12/22/documenting-your-numeric-life/">here</a> if you are curious). When Automattic bought them a while back, I was curious to see how it would influence its future. Now we get a much better idea. The web access maybe was an obvious “next step”, but they did a superb job of transposing most of the Day One experience on the web.</p>
<p>What could be the next step for Day One? Well, what about being able to blog from Day One? A dedicated “public” journal could be created and any entry saved into that journal would go online. Boom.</p>
<p>Now, if only I could spend more time writing personal thoughts in it.😒</p>

<p>And here we go again with the new Mac Pro “problem”. <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1512936">Jason Snell writing</a> about the challenges Apple is facing with the unfinished Apple Silicon transition of its Mac line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And all that custom work, all those distortions to what makes Apple silicon so successful, would be done for a product that’s a niche of a niche–and it’s work that Apple’s chip design team could have spent on a next-generation chip for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember the Trashcan Mac? The black cylinder Mac Pro was a closed system with very limited internal expandability beyond memory and SSD drive. Criticism from pro users lasted so long that Apple reverted his take on the Mac Pro with the return of the expandable machine in 2019. Pro users rejoiced as they could again add the PCI cards of their choices as well as adding as much memory they could afford. Problems fixed? Think again.</p>
<p>Now, enter the Apple Silicon chip: a highly regarded and efficient system-on-a-chip design with fixed amount of RAM and GPU (except for Pro, Max, Ultra flavours). A Mac Pro built around this chip would go against having 1 TB of RAM or external GPU without sacrificing latency and performance with support for RAM or eGPU. Apple Silicon makes the Mac a more closed system, just like the 2013 Trashcan Mac was. How ironic this is.</p>

<p>Attorney General Ashley Moody:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We must ensure that consumers have the information needed to make informed decisions about their data privacy and security. The existing lack of transparency in app stores can create a significant risk for American citizens, and could cause their personal information to be exploited by foreign entities of concern. <strong>That is why I am calling on Apple and Google to bring more transparency to their app stores—so consumers know what products are owned or developed by nations that may pose a national security risk.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a great idea. In challenging times, I want to know if an app is created or owned by someone who brings money into bad actor pockets. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2022/05/18/when-war-in-ukraine-influences-my-application-choices/">I do have internal debate about this issue from time to time</a>, having such labeling in the App Store would certainly help in my buying or subscription decisions.</p>

			 <p>I walked today with my dear wife and quickly chatted about the Ukraine war. My wife asked me a question I didn’t expect: what if Western countries who had already sent armaments to Ukraine were sending soldiers with a promise not to attack Russia on their territory? Is this what should happen after sending fighter jets if we ever get there? I don’t recall Zelensky asking for boots on the ground. Will he eventually get there?

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is a popular opinion or not, but Telegram is such a well-designed messaging app. It looks cool, and it has the right amount of gamification. Telegram.app feels native on all Apple platforms.</p>
<p>I use Telegram passively to subscribe to channels that publish news and information about the war in Ukraine essentially. Many of the publishers were on Twitter too, but I left this shitty platform. I don&rsquo;t use Telegram for chatting with others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pondering about subscribing. there are things that I don&rsquo;t like about Telegram (like insisting on getting access to my contacts and being owned by Pavel Durov). I don&rsquo;t like the owner&rsquo;s attitude toward Apple&rsquo;s App store rules in general. He&rsquo;s Russian with Ukrainian origins. Thankfully, is fled Moscow a long time ago to live in Dubai, a safe haven for many Russians these days. The fun fact is that Telegram is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-telegram-became-the-heart-of-the-ukraine-conflict-2022-3">hugely popular in Ukraine</a> and serves both sides in good and bad ways.</p>
<p>Are there any Telegram users here? Do you share my sentiment? Are you subscribing to the Premium tier?</p>

But tonight, while doing some cleanup on my WordPress website, I stumbled on this post, “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/04/13/confinement-a-visual-essay/" title="Confinement – A Visual Essay">Confinement – A Visual Essay</a>”, published on April 13th, 2020, in the early months of COVID-19. I almost instantly remembered and felt what it was like during these dire moments of confinement.</p>
<p>If pictures can trigger memories of challenging moments, I think they are good enough. This is why I am sharing this montage here tonight. Look carefully at each of them, they each contain a specific message.</p>

			 <p>This evening, using an Apple Shortcut called Clips, I imported the « <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/02/apple-in-2022-the-six-colors-report-card/">Apple in 2022 The Six Colors report card</a> » by Six Colors into Craft. It’s a 25 000 article that I started reading on my iPad, within Craft. Then, fifteen minutes into my reading, I asked Craft assistant to summarize the Mac section. It came out with this summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>« In 2022, Apple released the M2 MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Studio Display. The hardware in the Mac lineup is powerful and impressive, and the M2 MacBook Air has become a favorite of Mac users due to its light weight, zero noise, and long battery life, as well as its ability to handle workloads that used to require a pro-level desktop. macOS Ventura has some great features, but there is still backsliding represented by bugs that have gone unfixed and apps that don&rsquo;t work well. While many users are disappointed that an expected Mac Pro did not arrive, Apple is still praised for their strong hardware lineup and the Mac Studio, which might be a success except for the long shipping delays. »</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because I’m an Apple pundit; I read a lot about Apple in general, I find this summary « plausible », but also because I read the entire Mac section of the Six Colors report. Otherwise, I could I really know? This is where this article ChatGPT from Matt Birchler comes into view « <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/the-computer-is-wrong/">The Computer is Wrong</a> »: it’s fun to play with ChatGPT or any derivative services but staying critical, curious is still a mandatory thing to be these days.</p>

<p>OK, I’m excited. According to recent leaks, the iPhone 15 Pro could be ultra interesting (puns intended). I’m ok with USB-C; the time has come for standardization. The thing that gets me excited is the softer, slightly rounder hedges. I like the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro flat edges, but they are too rough for my taste. So flat edges with a softer corner radius will be a welcomed tweak.</p>
<p>Next, still about the edge, is the titanium brushed finish, similar to the titanium Apple Watch finish. I Digg this choice if that’s the case. I don’t like the Pro line’s current flashy chrome finish.</p>
<p>This leak of the possible iPhone 15 Pro also reminds me of the iPhone 4, which was a great design, BTW.</p>
<p>Oh, and the black bezels are becoming even thinner, which is also cool. Sure, some Android phones go way further than that, but on the iPhone, it’s a mandatory evolution, in my opinion.</p>
<p>For someone like me who takes his iPhone as a camera, these design changes could make a real difference in holding the iPhone like a camera. I’m really looking forward to this iPhone.</p>

<p>Apple is exploring a stand-alone device that combines an iPad with a speaker hub.

But Apple also has worked on an iPad docking accessory that it could sell separately and would accomplish much of the same thing.

<p>Nearly every day, I use my iPad in the kitchen while preparing food to listen to the news or to YouTube videos. I can imagine the iPad UI to be something like CarPlay UI (or HomeKit UI?) with tiles where I could see a video source, some HomeKit controls, the weather, etc.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/13/15-inch-macbook-air-display-production/">The rumoured launch of a 15-inch MacBook Air this early Spring</a> brings me joy and excitement. As an M1-MacBook Air owner, I understand the actual value of a lightweight and mighty Mac. I’m not looking for a much more powerful machine, but a bigger screen in a still-light package is something that I’m looking for. One of the reasons, you might be surprised, is the notch presence which removes some real space in the menubar to display menubar icons. Even with Bartender, a bigger screen could help reduce competition for the menubar on the left portion of the screen. That’s a small detail but an important one for me. I still have over a year of active Apple Care coverage, which should help resell my Mac.</p>
<p>Now, about the possible pricing. After spending some time on the Apple website looking at the current MacBook Air and MacBook Pro offerings, I expect the new 15-inch MacBook Air to be priced at around $1499..$1699 for an 8 GB of RAM, 8 cores CPU, 10 cores GPU and 256 GB SSD. So the starting price would represent a $300-$500 difference.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised to see the 13-inch MacBook Pro to be dropped from the product line too.</p>
<p>Spring can’t come soon enough.</p>

<p>I started testing Inoreader yesterday and Feedbin. Both seem good RSS readers, but none of them is satisfying. In fact, I’m never satisfied with anything when it comes to RSS readers and reading applications or services in general. It’s been going on forever.</p>
<p>Read-later apps are unsatisfying, too, for me. None of Instapaper, Pocket, Matter, and Readwise’s Reader satisfy my needs. Readwise is too busy and still immature, Matter is nice, but some things like tags handling don’t scale well.</p>
<p>The perfect combination of a read-later function with an RSS reader doesn’t exist. If I were twenty years younger, I would write my own.</p>

			 <p>I thought I was <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/02/07/matt-makes-a.html">done with the &ldquo;macOS user interface isn&rsquo;t touch-friendly&rdquo;</a> debate but tonight, I&rsquo;m reading this piece from Jack Wellborn (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mac was also built for a mouse, and while I would argue macOS is more usable than Windows, there is no getting around the fact that controls optimized for pointers are inherently unfriendly to touch input. <em><strong>It’s foolishly optimistic to think that Microsoft or even Apple can make pointer interfaces as touch friendly as iPadOS without also destroying the very thing that makes them more productive than iPadOS — information density</strong></em>. Smaller controls means these platforms can disclose more information and interactivity to their users at once. That’s why a bunch of windows on even a 11″ MacBook Air feels natural while only four windows on a “large” 13″ iPad feels ungainly.

</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversely, it’s impossible to make iPadOS more information dense without sacrificing the very thing that makes it the best tablet OS — touch friendliness. iPad users want more information on screen because that will help them be more productive, but the only way to present more information in iPadOS without sacrificing touch friendliness is a larger display. Not only is a larger display not portable, iPadOS’s support for larger displays still sucks. There’s nothing Apple can do about large displays not being portable, but better support for larger displays? That’s a problem Apple can solve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the author&rsquo;s suggestions at the end, but it shows that the debate about macOS being touch-friendly or not is still raging and far from being settled.</p>

			 <p>Dear Apple, I’m done. It took me a long time, but I get it. Today, I turned off Stage Manager on my iPad. I tried with all my heart. I tried. But, even at iPadOS 16.3, after betas and final releases, six months later, I tired of fighting. Stage Manager is a mess on the iPad. In fact, Stage Manager breaks the iPad experience. Plain and simple. What is a nice improvement on the Mac, is a disastrous UX on the iPad form factor. Apple, go back to the drawing board, let me know when you’re done. Thanks.</p>

<p>No. Great mockup design but no, I don’t want to get an Apple Watch Ultra in the form of an iPhone. First, I prefer flat edges over rounded ones. They make the iPhone easier to grab from a table and hold for taking pictures. Second, I want the rumoured rounded glass surface on the screen edges which would make the phone a little bit more organic.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/4d6f44c88c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>What I would LOVE ❤️ to get though is a dedicated multipurpose button, like on the Ultra. Yet, the probability that Apple add another button is low in my opinion. They would rather prefer to get rid of all physical buttons if they could without compromising usability (which I don’t see how this could be done). A less prominent camera assembly would be welcomed too, even if this means a thicker device (and bigger battery along the way).</p>

			 <p>Matt makes a compelling case for the feasibility of touch-based macOS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think Apple should add touch to Macs, and I think that this will allow them to not only make current form factors better, but it will allow them to create Macs that are more flexible, more powerful, and more accessible than any Macs before them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That said, there are people in the Mac community who disagree with me here, and their number one concern is that macOS has a UI that is simply unusable with touch. It&rsquo;s the ace-in-the-hole argument, and it&rsquo;s honestly something I haven&rsquo;t pushed back on because it feels true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m one of them. 🫣</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a narrative out there that touch is just so incompatible with macOS and that in order to make it work, the macOS UI would have to get blown up to comical proportions, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case. Changes will be made, but I think macOS is more touch-friendly today than many people give it credit for.

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to report that I&rsquo;m convinced that macOS is closer to being touch-friendly than I originally thought. Matt spent the required time to demonstrate that 90% of the job was already done. I&rsquo;m happy to change my mind on this. Would I jump to use a touchscreen Mac?

		<a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/02/07/no-olympic-games.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-02-07 06:41:01 -0500">Feb 7, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Should Russians be allowed to participate in the Olympic Games in Paris, France, next year? The question is out, and the debate is already raging. For me, the answer is simple and unequivocal: no. My reasons are multiple. Here are a few of them.</p>
<p>First of all, we cannot pretend that Olympic Games are apolitical. Participation or non-participation in games can also have a political character. History has shown it on several occasions. In addition, the symbolism behind the Olympic Games and sports, in general, is not compatible with the behaviour of Russia internationally. The Russians are doing anything but show fraternity towards other countries like Ukraine.</p>
<p>Cases are well documented that local Olympic organizations are often close to the government, especially in countries like Russia and China. Governments jump at the opportunity of hosting or participating in games to promote political agendas, to make propaganda tacitly or explicitly. We cannot provide them with this opportunity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we cannot contribute militarily, financially and humanly to the legitimate defence of Ukraine and, on the other hand, allow Russian athletes to come and strut as if nothing had happened alongside Ukrainian athletes. This is nonsense and an insult to Ukrainian athletes.</p>
<p>Some will say that it is not the role of the International Olympic Committee to act as a police officer. However, it is not about that but about a moral question that goes beyond the committee&rsquo;s mission. The respective countries will be responsible for demonstrating their coherence with their actions towards Ukraine by abstaining from presenting themselves at the Olympic Games, if appropriate. I count on the Canadian government to show consistency and courage equal to that of the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Finally, the question of the athletes themselves arises. Some will say that we must not unduly hinder athletes from participating in the games after so many efforts and sacrifices. Do I need to remind you that thousands of Ukrainian civilians are making the ultimate sacrifice of their own lives? Russian athletes can stay home and suffer a little bit. Besides, isn&rsquo;t this one of the objectives of international sanctions against Russia, to make the government and its people suffer? Otherwise, what good is it?</p>
<p>I say it, I repeat it, it would be immoral to allow Russians to participate in the Olympic Games next year, and even in any other sporting competition, as long as the war is raging and Russia has not paid reparations.</p>

<p>I couldn’t put my finger on it (pun intended), but this article brings up an interesting point that might explain something I couldn&rsquo;t do myself: The size of controls in a user interface largely dictates information density. Many longtime Mac users decry the iPadification of its UI. I&rsquo;m not one of them but I value information density a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the time, I see people swipe up and down on their vertical laptop screens to navigate webpages and zoom into photos with a pinch gesture. The ergonomics of this are naturally poor. Stretching your arm out forwards to reach the laptop screen quickly becomes uncomfortable. And yet, people still do it frequently. The touch screen is used as an accessory to primary mouse input. They swipe around a bit, then they go back to the mouse. They read a screenful of content, then they swipe to the next page, and put their arm back down. It’s a surprisingly subconsciously natural thing to do. Source: <a href="https://bzamayo.com/touchscreen-mac-rumor">Apple Working On Touchscreen Mac Laptops — Benjamin Mayo</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Apple could get away with only supporting minimal gestures on their touchscreen Mac. I&rsquo;m thinking about things like &ldquo;pinch to zoom&rdquo; or &ldquo;swipe&rdquo; but nothing else… I could imagine using my left hand for a vertical swipe and the right hand on the trackpad to click on a button or text field. This way, I see only a need for a minimal macOS user interface rework.</p>

<p>Can you imagine unboxing your brand-new iPhone, powering it up, and after completing the initial setup process, you end up on a mostly empty home screen? What should the user do next? Could Apple provide a single icon pointing to their App Store to download &ldquo;The Full iPhone Experience&rdquo; package?  Would Apple even be allowed to do just that? Reading the recommendation again, I think it would go against it. It there a more effective way at killing a product?</p>

<p>Even if Apple actually comes out with something this year, I’ll consider this as a technological proof of concept, nothing compared to the actually useful and usable iPhone we got back in 2007.</p>
<p>Use cases for a headset are not what the tech pundits would like us to believe. Family reunions with everyone wearing these things on our heads will not happen. Office meetings with people wearing them don’t make sense either. We can barely stand meetings in hybrid modes where some employees are working from home and appearing on the big screen while others are “present” in the meeting room staring at their laptop or tablet screen and doing something else.</p>
<p>The Apple headset could be the next HomePod or the next iPod HiFi. Set your expectations accordingly and better pay attention to what will come out from <a href="https://hu.ma.ne/">Hu.ma.ne</a>, instead. Something that looks to be much more natural and less rebarbative.</p>

			 <p>Don&rsquo;t bother reading too much into the latest Apple financial numbers. They&rsquo;re not too bad. What you should be paying attention to is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple is eliminating one of its most high-profile executive positions. According to a new report today, Apple is eliminating the role of “industrial design chief” as part of a broader shake-up. This role was once held by Jony Ive, and most recently held by Evans Hankey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under this new structure, the design team will report to Apple’s chief operating officer Jeff Williams. Source: <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/02/apple-industrial-design-chief-role/">Apple is eliminating its iconic &lsquo;industrial design chief&rsquo; position</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This comment by one of the 9To5Mac staff members is not reassuring at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s important to keep in mind, however, that Williams has been involved with the design team for several years at this point. Hankey has reported to Williams since 2019. The difference now is that the middle ground between Williams and the rest of the design team is being removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe Hankey saw this coming and couldn&rsquo;t adhere to this direction. Here&rsquo;s my take: ops are taking over Apple, and design is no longer the top priority. It is utterly troubling to read rumours of Williams possibly replacing Cook which looks like being more of the same if you ask me. Maybe Williams has more design experience, but not as a first-party involvement. Troubling.</p>

			 <p>Some telling excerpt from <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-evening-update-canadian-sniper-in-ukraine-describes-russians-stubborn/">a recent story</a> in the Globe and Mail about a Canadian helping Ukraine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a couple of shots I made that day that will be with me,” he said. One was a Russian in a T-shirt who was carrying a box of ammunition more than 1,800 metres behind the front line – a distance Teflon says was the longest shot he’s ever made. “He saw no threat, he thought he was safe. But it’s my job to ensure that they know that they’re not safe anywhere,” Teflon said. “The role of a sniper is to ultimately push into the minds of the enemy and make them question everything.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s allegations that all these Russians must be drugged. There’s no way. I think it’s just lack of training. Because they still act like human beings. I’ve watched guys cry and I’ve watched guys scream and I’ve watched guys try to pull their friends back when they get killed. They’re humans but they don’t have an ounce of training when it comes to fighting a war.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sadly, it’s working. That’s why they’re doing it. We’re defending until we can’t defend that spot any more because they just destroy it with tanks. And they just keep sending another wave. It’s just relentless,” Teflon said. “So, they’ve gained 500 metres of dirt, but they just took over a completely destroyed position and lost hundreds of guys to do so.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The world deserves to hear the truth and after losing Joe and Greg, they need to understand we’re not stopping this work,” he said. “There’s no point me dying without telling my story.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This a poignant story about a Canadian snipper “working” on the front line in Ukraine.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/28/next-generation-carplay-features/">CarPlay in 2023</a> will see its most significant upgrade since its launch. I don’t know when we’ll actually be able to get this in a real car, but I certainly look forward to it.</p>
<p>I recently spent some travel time in a high-end Mercedes. The Dashboard was very impressive. Still, the future CarPlay version seems a bit pale in comparison.</p>
<p>Why did Apple choose to make this early announcement?</p>

They were all deleted. Quitting Twitter also means stopping spreading references to the platform’s content.</p>

			 <p>I’m super happy to see so many countries contributing to the war efforts. Kyiv has been asking for tanks for a long time. Finally, the last roadblock to a significant contribution has been lifted thanks to the German government, who seemingly found the light and made the right decision. Now for serious questions…</p>
<p>Will those tanks, a few hundred of them, of all sizes, models and with various capabilities, really reverse the tide in favour of the Ukrainians? I’m afraid we will have to face reality sooner than later. Much more will be needed to put Russia’s army on its knees and force them to retreat or be defeated. Fighter jets are next. But again, I don’t see that as being enough. Remember when Iraq invaded Kuwait? We had to send people on the ground, not just boats, tanks or fighter jets.</p>
<p>I guess that, collectively, the west is not ready to accept this fatality. The time will come.</p>

<p>I recently took a taxi ride to leave the airport as Uber taxis were unavailable and plagued with longer than usual delays. We were directed to the traditional taxi lines. I couldn’t use an app on my iPhone to call a taxi instead.</p>
<p>Boy, it was a trip in the past. The taxi driver had no Google or Waze open to know where to go, only his memory and his knowledge of the city. The taxi timer was this old and ugly box installed on his car dash, partially blocking his view.</p>
<p>It was disorienting not to get any feedback about how long the trip would go, what was the best road alternatives along the way, and not having a driver reputation score.</p>
<p>You would think that Uber would kick the butt of taxi companies so they evolve the customer experience and get their shit together to build a competitive experience, but no. They seem to have given up a long time ago.</p>
<p>My message to taxi companies: enjoy the ride while it last.</p>

			 <p>More details are emerging about the rumoured Apple&rsquo;s headset&hellip; and this is troubling&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the headset will &ldquo;feel familiar to Apple users,&rdquo; with an interface that is close to identical to the look of an ‌iPhone‌ or an ‌iPad‌. There will be a Home screen with app icons that can be rearranged, as well as customizable widgets. Source: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/23/apple-mixed-reality-headset-interface-details/">Apple&rsquo;s Mixed Reality Headset to Feature iOS-Like Interface, Advanced Hand Tracking, and Will Work as Second Display for Mac - MacRumors</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh boy&hellip; I would expect a brand-new metaphor for the brand-new form factor. Otherwise, by using a familiar interface, it&rsquo;s as if Apple is locked into their own creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Likely to be named &ldquo;Reality Pro,&rdquo; the headset will be able to switch between augmented reality and virtual reality. Augmented reality will overlay virtual objects on the real world, while virtual reality is an entirely virtual environment that shuts out the wearer&rsquo;s surroundings. Augmented reality functions will work through a pass-through mode that will use the exterior cameras on the headset, and swapping between AR and VR will be done with a Digital Crown-like control knob.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Reality Pro&rdquo;!!!?? Someone must be kidding about that one, right? What an awful name! What about &ldquo;viewPod&rdquo;? Or something less &ldquo;Macintosh Performa 620&rdquo;-type of thing, please.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those who wear glasses, Apple will provide custom lenses that are able to sit within the enclosure, and Apple is expecting users to wear AirPods to get an audio experience on par with the visual experience that the headset provides, though it will have built-in speakers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As previously rumored, the headset will have an external battery pack to prevent it from overheating on a user&rsquo;s face due to the high-end Mac chips used for the device. <strong>The battery is approximately the size of two iPhone 14 Pro Max models stacked on top of one another, and it will power the headset for around two hours. An external battery will allow users to swap one battery and charge another to use the device for a longer period of time.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Just no. It&rsquo;s a proof of concept sold to consumers.</p>

<p>For 2023, Apple is reportedly working on a larger 15-inch MacBook Air to join its Mac lineup. The new MacBook Air will feature the upcoming M3 chip, according to Bloomberg&rsquo;s Mark Gurman. The 15-inch MacBook Air is expected to feature the same design as the current 13.6-inch model but with a larger display and longer battery life thanks to the efficiency of the M3 chip and the inclusion of a larger battery. Source: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/23/whats-next-for-the-mac/">What&rsquo;s Next for the Mac: M3 iMac, 15-Inch MacBook Air, Mac Pro, and More - MacRumors</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The possible 15-inch MacBook Air makes a lot of sense from a product line perspective (non pro machine with high portability but a larger screen). Where I disagree with Gurman is the possibility of the device getting an M3 chip. This is way too early. The rest of the product line is still on the just-released M2. When the Mac Pro finally makes the switch, then the M3 is a higher probability. In other words, I expect to see the 15-inch MacBook Air to get the same M2 chip as the current but smaller ones.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been watching a few beginner videos about <strong>Final Cut Pro</strong> just because I’m searching for ways to improve my video production workflow. The new problem now is this: how do I export recording segments out of Screenflow so I can import them in Final Cut Pro? There is currently no easy way to do this automatically. The process is manual but documented in a Telestream forum. I’m not so sure the use of Final Cur Pro would be a boon to my workflow. Back to square one, but I learned a few things about Final Cut Pro and Screenflow export options. It’s a good thing in the end, as I won’t find a reason to upgrade to an M2 Pro Mac mini. 🤣</p>

<p>I’ve been testing <strong>Continuity Camera</strong> mode with my iPhone 13 Pro as the video and audio sources for recording with <strong>Screenflow</strong>. I must say that I was very impressed and positively surprised.</p>
<p>First, the video quality is excellent, and I get Center Stage as a bonus. Screenflow sees this as a standard camera source. Second, using the Voice Isolation option, I no longer hear background noises in the house, which is cool because I’ll stop asking people to be less noisy neighbours. Now, <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/01/21/integrating-adobe-enhance.html">If only I could integrate Adobe Enhance Voice into my workflow</a>… 🙏</p>
<p>Solution found (<a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/01/21/integrating-adobe-enhance.html">link</a>)!</p>
<p>I may have a Blue Yeti microphone for sale soon!</p>

		<a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/01/21/integrating-adobe-enhance.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-21 11:56:15 -0500">Jan 21, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone knows about this free web tool by Adobe: <strong>Enhance Voice</strong> (<a href="https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance#">link</a>), but it is really impressive (<a href="https://micro.blog/birchtree@mastodon.social">@MattBirchler</a> knows about it). Here is what I&rsquo;d like to do: find a way to integrate this tool into my video production workflow.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m producing YouTube videos with <strong>ScreenFlow</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos">my YouTube Channel</a>). So far, I&rsquo;m ok with the results, but I think my voice, and the sound in general, could be improved (I&rsquo;m using the Blue Yeti Microphone, but Adobe Enhance Voice is really impressive).</p>
<p>So, how can I:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do my recording sessions as usual</li>
<li>Do my video montage as usual</li>
<li>Extract the audio track</li>
<li>Use Adobe Enhance Voice to re-process the audio track</li>
<li>Replace the audio track in my Screenflow document</li>
<li>Export the final video</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 3 and 5 are not possible in the current release of Screenflow. Any suggestion of tools I could use instead?</p>
<p>Here’s what I know or already use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Permute</strong> allows for easy conversion of audio files, including converting video files into the audio-only version.</li>
<li><strong>QuickTime Player</strong> can export the audio track only out of a video file.</li>
<li>I know how to use <strong>iMovie</strong>.</li>
<li>I’m a happy user of <strong>Audio Hijack</strong></li>
<li>I don’t really want to get rid of Screenflow. <strong>LumaFusion</strong>, <strong>FinalCut Pro</strong>, etc., maybe could do the job here, but it would be ok if I could find a simple utility that can replace the audio track easily instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>This question has been posted to the Screenflow Telestream forum.</p>
<hr>
<p>Update #1: corrected a few typos but added the solution using iMovie. Here’s the solution.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do my recording sessions as usual</li>
<li>Do my video montage as usual and export the video</li>
<li>Extract the audio track using Permute in .MP3 format</li>
<li>Use Adobe Enhance Voice to re-process the audio track</li>
<li>Convert .WAV into .MP3</li>
<li>Launch iMovie and create a new Project</li>
<li>Import the produced video in step 2</li>
<li>Detach the audio track and delete it</li>
<li>Add the enhanced version of the audio track</li>
<li>Export the final video using iMovie’s share option</li>
</ol>
<p>Voilà!</p>
<p>Update #2: there is a major issue with this process, the video and audio are not in sync over time, even though both files are of the same duration. This is not something easy to fix. Back to the drawing board. 😒</p>

			 <p>Here are a few questions that pop up in my mind when reading the news about the war in Ukraine.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How do they estimate Russian casualties? They are around 500-800 KIA per day. That’s a lot. Is this number inflated for propaganda purposes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is Putin not saying, “Any country sending arms to help Ukraine is, in fact, a declaration of war against Russia”? What would be the implications of such a declaration? Putin looks like a low-profile leader. So why is Putin not more vocal against the west?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the West not sending military aid to Modlova to put pressure on the 1200 Russian soldiers in Transnistria? How is it possible for Russia to feed them with the required resources?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are tanks so much needed instead of other types of weapons? Are fighter planes effective? What is the aviation role in Ukraine? Are they making a difference?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many Ukrainian soldiers are killed each day? Why don’t we get these numbers as much as the Russian KIA?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So many unanswered questions.</p>

			 <p>Google&rsquo;s official announcement of incoming layoffs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have some difficult news to share. We’ve decided to reduce our workforce by approximately 12,000 roles. We’ve already sent a separate email to employees in the US who are affected. In other countries, this process will take longer due to local laws and practices. Source: <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/january-update/">A difficult decision to set us up for the future</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And comment from Gruber:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are numerous reasons the tech industry wound up at this layoffpalooza, but I think the main reason is that the biggest companies got caught up in a game where they tried to hire everyone, whether they needed them or not, to keep talent away from competitors and keep talent away from small upstarts (or from founding their own small upstarts). These big companies were just hiring to hire, and now the jig is up. Source: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my view on this. Google is not alone. Microsoft and Meta announced major layoffs too. I&rsquo;ve been working in IT for over thirty years, and I have never been in such a situation where we have so much difficulty finding or hiring new people. Big companies are competing for great talent not only with each other but also draining talent from smaller companies. It&rsquo;s very difficult to compete in this context.</p>
<p>I think what is happening is not as catastrophic as it sounds. We will see a redistribution of the workforce in the industry. A lot of talent is being freed in the process from the big ones and is now available for the smaller companies where management is more sound, and financial posture is in good shape.</p>

			 <p>There’s this question that keeps popping up in my mind all the time since I’m being more active on Micro.blog. Why am I getting way more interactions with others on Micro.blog compared to Twitter? What am I doing differently? I write about the same subjects, albeit maybe more frequently. I think I have a few possible explanations.</p>
<p>First, Twitter is full of bots. Twitter is a dumpster. I suspect many people or organizations are simply cross-posting stuff on Twitter without real human beings behind the content. I did exactly that myself via Buffer for a few years. Optimizing exposure by scheduling posts at the “right” time was the idea. A bot worked for me.</p>
<p>Second, and this is probably the most probable reason: algorithmic timeline. The Twitter engine is tuned to generate higher engagement. The more you engage, the higher the probability that your content will appear on people’s timelines. If you’re well-known, again, the higher the likelihood that you will make it to the timeline of others.</p>
<p>I’m not well-known. I didn’t engage that much with others. Both made me a near-nobody on Twitter. So I didn’t get exposure, hence the lack of engagement with my content.</p>
<p>Third, there is just too much noise on Twitter to get noticed. My content competes against the rest of the Twittosphere. My context was noise for others, hence the lack of feedback, comments, and interactions.</p>
<p>Here on Micro.blog? Night and day. I’m not a star, far from it. But I get a sense that some people are paying attention.</p>
<p>Thanks for that anyway. 🤗</p>

			 <p>So, I started the cleanup of <a href="https://numericcitizen.me">numericcitizen.me</a>. Each day, on WordPress.com, I look at my past posts and select the ones that won&rsquo;t make the cut. Most of them are simply deleted. However, some posts get exported in markdown files before being deleted. Those exported posts, in turn, are imported in Craft for archival purposes. It&rsquo;s a tedious process.</p>
<p>Before moving to Ghost, I want to bring the most valuable content. But, what is valuable content, actually? I realize that I have put a lot of time and effort into writing in the past several years. Some posts are short and very time or context-specific. Today, they no longer sport any value except for giving a glimpse of what was. Then what? Nothing. It&rsquo;s probably more of a value to me than to my readers. I probably should be writing in a personal journal instead, right?</p>
<p>Anyhow, it&rsquo;s time to move on. I know what I want <a href="https://numericcitizen.me">numericcitizen.me</a> to become. But, in its current form and content, it&rsquo;s off. There is too much noise, I want it to be more focused. Deleted old, insignificant posts will help, but at the cost of time and losing some of my memories.</p>

			 <p>Here is something that I always find funny. On any photo-sharing platform, let&rsquo;s say you like someone&rsquo;s pictures. The guy will probably get notified and start looking at your photos, generally only the most recent ones. If you&rsquo;re lucky, he or she will like a few of them and then boom, start following you. It&rsquo;s like someone who&rsquo;s clicking with another on the dance floor. 😂</p>

			 <p>The time has come for the return of a more open web. I’m embracing this movement by joining platforms or services that are built on open standards and promoting the open web in general as a byproduct.</p>
<p>Write.as is an instantiation version of the <a href="https://writefreely.org/">WriteFreely</a> writing platform, available as an open-source project. Think of WriteFreely as the open-source version of WordPress. Anyone can get the source and install their own instance.</p>
<p>In May 2022, I took advantage of five-year special pricing to subscribe to the Write.as platform. Without exactly knowing what would be my use case for it, I decided to support the platform, just like I’ve been supporting Micro.blog since 2018. After a while, I discovered the many facets of this writing ecosystem and found it to be a bit confusing. In this article, I explain all the parts of the open and dedicated blogging platform.</p>
<p>First, let’s see what ChatGPT says about Write.as (unedited responses from ChatGPT):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aaron Taylor is the founder &amp; CEO of <a href="http://cosmic.org/">Cosmic.org</a> and a team of remote employees who work on the <a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a> and <a href="http://remark.as/">Remark.as</a>platforms. He is passionate about creating secure, anonymous spaces where people can express themselves without judgement or censorship. He has worked to create tools and features that make anonymous publishing easier and more secure for users. He is also the creator of the <a href="http://remark.as/">Remark.as</a> platform, which gives users more control over how and when they share their thoughts.</p>
<p><a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a> is a project of a small team led by the founder &amp; CEO, Aaron Taylor, at <a href="http://cosmic.org/">Cosmic.org</a>. They are a remote team based all over the world, from Portland to Berlin to Mexico City.</p>
<p><a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a> is a platform designed to help people express themselves freely and anonymously. It provides a space for everyone to post their thoughts without worry of judgement or censorship. All posts are public and open to comments, however, the identities of the posters can remain anonymous. The project offers a suite of applications and services to make anonymous publishing easier, more secure, and more secure for users. It also provides a way for people to follow topics, publications, or users, engaging in thoughtful dialogue and idea exchange.</p>
<p><a href="http://remark.as/">Remark.as</a> is a project that is a part of the <a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a> platform. It is designed to help users to have conversations with each other in an anonymous, secure, and censorship-free environment. <a href="http://remark.as/">Remark.as</a> has features like tagging topics and publications, creating polls, and engaging in private forums. It also gives users more control over how and when they share their thoughts. <a href="http://remark.as/">Remark.as</a>also provides users with the ability to create polls, surveys, and other interactive features to encourage public participation.</p>
<p>All in all, <a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a> and <a href="http://remark.as/">Remark.as</a> are projects by Aaron Taylor and the team at <a href="http://cosmic.org/">Cosmic.org</a> that provide users with an anonymous, censorship-free space in which to express themselves freely and engage with others. They are both designed to make anonymous publishing easier, more secure, and to give users more control over how and when they share their thoughts.</p>
<p><a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a> is a simple, privacy-focused writing platform. It allows users to create and publish anonymous blog posts, journal entries, and other types of writing without the need for an account or personal information. The platform also includes a built-in editor and the ability to customize the appearance of your writing with different fonts and themes. Additionally, <a href="http://write.as/">Write.as</a> supports markdown formatting and has a feature called &ldquo;focuses&rdquo; which allows users to group related posts together. The platform is designed for those who value privacy and simplicity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More seriously, here’s a brief description of each component, starting with an overview.</p>
<h3 id="an-overview-of-the-writefreely-ecosystem"><strong>An Overview of the WriteFreely Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>The following diagram shows all the parts making up the Write.as service, which is part of the WriteFreely ecosystem.
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2024/89ff6fb799.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Write.as service is where all the writing experience happens. Since this article isn’t a review, suffice it to say the editor offers a minimalistic and distraction-free environment. Write.as supports adding tags to any blog posts. Cross-posting content in Write.as is available for other platforms like Tumblr, Ghost and Twitter. I connected my account to Ghost but rarely cross-post over there. It’s nice to have, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The writer can attach photos at the end of each post by dragging them on the bottom bar. Photos attachments go to the “<a href="https://snap.as/">snap.as</a>” minimalistic photo sharing add-on, tied to Write.as. All photos attachments are shown in one place, on snap.as. Photo galleries are available, albeit with a 10$ one-time purchase. Some features are marked as coming soon, but I suspect they are long in coming. I&rsquo;m unsure if I would invest in this as I prefer dedicated services like Glass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit.as is another add-on to Write.as. As the name suggests, it is a way for an author to accept submissions from other writers. No registration is required from the submitter, helping a frictionless experience. This service is not cheap and comes with a 12$ per month minimal fee. It’s not cheap and I don’t know why. Again, integration with other platforms is marked as coming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remark.as is yet another add-on closely tied to Write.as and offers commenting to any of the writer’s blog posts. Commenting is enabled on a per-post basis by adding a special &lt;—discuss—&gt; line anywhere within the post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read.write.as is like a content feed coming from other writers. Content published on Write.as gets published on this feed. It comes from the hosted version of Write.as. According to this website, content is cross-posted to an RSS feed, Mastodon and Twitter, but I fear this has been abandoned as the content is somewhat old.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Mail add-on is where you’ll receive comments from other writers. Those comments are grouped in one place and are public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Café is a place for discussion, but frankly, I don’t know how posts get promoted there. Those discussions are conversations happening on the Read.write.as section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other add-ons like a post signature are available for a one-time purchase of 10$ and eBooks export is also available for another one-time purchase of 10$.</p>
<p>Still with me? I know it’s not simple. Write.as certainly feels like a bunch of add-ons taped together.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2024/8173388b11.jpg" alt=""></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-remarks-about-the-whole-thing"><strong>Some remarks about the whole thing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Write.as experience is minimalistic and in need of some polishing. I didn’t see improvements since I’m subscribing to the platform. This annoys me.</li>
<li>Overall, the Write.as ecosystem feels minimalistic and unfinished. I don’t expect many improvements to come to the platform. Yet, Matt, the founder of Write.as, is active on discuss.write.as discussion forum, so it’s a good sign.</li>
<li>There’s a Mac app for the Write.freely ecosystem, which should support Write.as but it has been in beta for more than a year. iOS and iPadOS are also available. All apps are available <a href="https://writefreely.org/apps">here</a>. I didn&rsquo;t test these, preferring the web experience.</li>
<li>All these services are part of a suite called the Musing Studio. It’s more of a branding thing. The site hasn’t been updated for a while.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this article, I hope I shed some light on this open-source project dedicated to writers and bloggers. Overall I like Write.as, even with some rough edges or unfinished integration. If I failed to explain something correctly, let me know in the comments!</p>
<p>Update #1: Some references to subscription fees for add-ons have been corrected to one-time purchases, as required. It was an error based on the documentation miss-interpretation.</p>

			 <p>Interesting (and sadly valid point) from Om Malik:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of age, the big elephant in the room is that we are certified addicts to attention.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether it is Twitter, Instagram, or Mastodon. Everyone is playing to an audience. The social Internet is a performance theater praying at the altar of attention. Journalists need attention to be relevant, and experts need to signal their expertise. And others want to be influencers. For now, Twitter, Instagram, and their ilk give the biggest bang for the blast. It is why those vocal and active about Mastodon are still posting away on Musk’s Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we didn’t care for attention, we wouldn’t be doing anything at all. We wouldn’t broadcast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We care. I certainly care that you care about my content, my words, and my thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, we would socialize privately in communication with friends and peers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even in this social scenario, we are broadcasting and expecting that people are listening. This is how we are programmed. This is why social networks, and the web in general, are so addictive.</p>

			 <p>Today, from WordPress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your favorite Jetpack-powered features from the WordPress app – including Stats, Notifications, and the Reader – have a new home: the Jetpack app! These features will soon be removed from the WordPress app so that its focus will be on essential user and publishing tools. With the Jetpack app, you can expect the same attention to core features like managing and editing content, as well as next-level tools to grow your audience on a trusted platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The JetPack app is now officially being pushed out, and WP asks site owners like me to consider transitioning to JetPack for managing the website and viewing stats. I&rsquo;m not sure why the one-app-fits-all&quot; is considered in need of a rework. I&rsquo;ve read the blog post and couldn&rsquo;t find a real reason worth forking these apps into two. Even more strange, when you run both WordPress and JetPack on the same device, the latter suggests removing the former from the device. Anyways&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I want to spend too much energy trying to understand what&rsquo;s going on. The reason is that I&rsquo;m in the early stage of planning my migration off the WordPress.com platform. It will require some serious planning and some tedious work, but I&rsquo;ll move out, before the end of the present year.</p>

Close to Twitter but with less clutter. I’m on a 10 days trial period. Tested the web posting interface. Tested the native macOS (light) client. Tested the iPad version too. Now, testing cross-posting from WordPress via an IFTTT applet. I’m loving it so far.

			 <p>Up until now, the Mastodon ecosystem felt like some sort of black magic to me. Today I spent a few minutes explaining to my wife what Mastodon is. As someone who already knows about Twitter and its subtleties, she got it pretty quickly. I couldn’t have done it a few weeks ago, but now, I could. I always thought that when you can explain something to someone, it is probably because you know enough about the subject. I think my explanation made sense to her, and for me! It was only then that the magic and the profound nature of the social and decentralized network became so clear to me. It was an enlightening moment, for sure. Better late than never. I instantly felt convinced that my awakening to the open web and Mastodon, a form of open web instantiation, would be a game-changer for me.</p>

			 <p>Today, for some reason, I decided to delve into the <strong>Write.as</strong> &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been subscribing to this writing service for nearly a year, I post from time to time like <a href="https://write.as/numericcitizen/heres-what-i-would-do-after-winning-1-35-billion-jackpot">I did yesterday</a>. I&rsquo;m not so sure to grasp all of it. To get started, I went into Craft, and through the Craft Assistant, I asked a few questions (since ChatGPT seems overloaded). I got surprisingly good results, enough to get some context around the <a href="https://writefreely.org">write.freely</a> project. Then, I started a diagram illustrating all the components of the platform. This will become a blog post for sure. Today, I have a better understanding of this project.</p>
<p>What I want to emphasize here is the help that a service like ChatGPT (through an app) can bring to kick-start a small project like this. I&rsquo;m blown away. But I&rsquo;m staying critical too. More on that eventually.</p>

			 <p>After I told my wife that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/13/us/mega-millions-jackpot-drawing-numbers-friday/index.html">the second-biggest jackpot had been won</a>, she asked me what I would do with all that money. So here’s what I would do.</p>
<p>First, after the usual and probably mandatory press conference, I would get home and patiently wait for the deposit. Once received, I would call my bank to set aside a few million for my personal needs (and for my immediate family, of course).</p>
<p>Then the fun would begin.</p>
<p>Second, I would reach the highest Canadian Government representative, telling him I wanted to meet with Zelensky from Ukraine. The sooner, the better, and I would make sure he gets the message that he should accept my request and wouldn’t regret any minutes of this meeting.</p>
<p>Once in Ukraine, I would ask to meet with the government’s and army’s top lieutenants. My question for them: I have more than $1 billion at your disposal; what do you need the most? I would make sure they get what they are asking for.</p>
<p>After my meeting, I would ask for a joint press conference with Zelensky, telling the world about our agreement and explaining what will happen with all my money spent on helping this country and its people. Next, I would read a message aloud to the wealthiest people in the world and ask them to move their butt and make something out of their money to help Ukraine. Third, and lastly, I would read another special message, this time directed at Putin: “now is the time to put me on the ‘banned from Russia list’” and I would conclude with, “you can go fuck yourself.”</p>
<p>This is what I would do after winning a $1.35 Billion Jackpot. Thank you.</p>

			 <p>There are a lot of rumours surrounding the upcoming Apple headset. I call them noise at best. I&rsquo;m afraid Apple is losing focus on other areas, which would require much more attention to benefit this project. Maybe I&rsquo;ll eat my words when this thing finally comes out. Maybe I&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;OMG, now I understand what the fuss it was all about&rdquo;. In the meantime, this conclusion from John Gruber is pretty much in line with my view: what is the point?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This headset project is very much real and, I believe, very much shipping this year. But the fundamental question remains: What’s the point? Think back to Steve Jobs’s presentation announcing the original iPad — the nut of the whole keynote was Jobs explaining where the iPad might fit between an iPhone and MacBook. If it didn’t serve some tasks not just a little but a lot better than either an iPhone or Mac, there was no point to the iPad. The same is true for this headset. And if it costs $3,000 and/or requires a tethered battery strapped around your waist, the “this better be an awesome experience” bar is raised even higher. Source: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/information_apple_headset">Daring Fireball: Knee-Jerk Reactions and Thoughts Regarding The Information’s Latest Report on Apple’s Upcoming Headset</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;ll never buy such a thing. We&rsquo;re already too much sucked into tech, I won&rsquo;t accept putting a headset on my face and pretending that this is cool. It is not.</p>

			 <p>👉🏻 Well, that was fast: <a href="https://micro.blog/numericcitizen@techhub.social">@numericcitizen@techhub.social</a> 😎</p>
<p>Reasons why I joined this Mastodon instance. 1) I like the name &ldquo;techhub.social&rdquo;. 2) It&rsquo;s operated by a Canadian. 3) He speaks french and has a Ukrainian flag on his profile.. 4) I&rsquo;ll be able to see the interaction between Micro.blog and a Mastodon instance.</p>
<p><strong>Micro.blog will stay my home</strong>, but I&rsquo;ll experiment with Mastodon, even though I said and wrote that I would focus this year. Damn.</p>

			 <p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJZZzBUXb6o">video</a> from <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="mailto:birchtree@mastodon.social">birchtree@mastodon.social</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> resonated greatly with me today. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>First, someone is finally calling out something about software subscriptions that I always wanted to call out myself. Every developer seems entitled to charge a subscription for whatever reason. Matt brilliantly illustrates that some subscriptions are ok, some are borderline ok, but others are not.</p>
<p>For applications like Notion or Craft, developers must pay costs for hosting the backend. For example, Craft&rsquo;s backend seems to be on the AWS cloud. In that specific case, it&rsquo;s clear that a subscription makes sense. So we must help the developers pay their bills, right?</p>
<p>Things get more controversial when the developers charge for a subscription, even though no backend services are required. Why would the developers go with a subscription model, then, you might ask? Well, this is where I want to chime in. The developers may not have to pay hosting costs, but what about their development time? It is as if we value infrastructure costs more than craftmanship time. It should not be this way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to pay for software or service using a subscription if the product comes with updates regularly. Matt has shown Tweetbot as an example. Well, this isn&rsquo;t the best example because Tweetbot rarely gets any updates; it doesn&rsquo;t fit my criteria for using a subscription. CleanShot X, absolutely yes. I recognize, through my subscription, not only the value of the service but the time it took to put it together and keep it running fine. I&rsquo;m willing to support the developer for that through a subscription.</p>
<p>We pay 5$ for a drink that takes less than a minute to prepare at Starbucks. Why is it so hard to pay for developers&rsquo; time, spending weeks or months writing great software? Also, we must try to consider not only backend bills when deciding that a subscription is ok; craftmanship is something to pay for too.</p>

			 <p>I really like how Substack is evolving as a platform for content creators, especially for writers. I kept my account open after moving from Substack to Ghost.org. You may disagree with the fact that you don&rsquo;t really own the content or whatever, but Substack is evolving quite a bit. If I compare the features set when it started and today, it is night and day. They are really killing it. As a member of Substack (free) and Ghost (paid), I would say Substack &gt; Ghost.</p>
<p>I would really like to find a niche use case for Substack. And I thought that 2023 was the year of focusing more.</p>

<p>As we can see, while there are definite improvements in Windows 11’s design consistency, they are somewhat superficial (but still more thorough than those that were introduced with Windows 10), and there still is plenty of room for improvement. However, compared to Windows 10, at least most of the “casual” UI is somewhat consistent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2023 Windows 11 will reportedly get 3 of the new “moment” updates, which are supposed to bring in new features and UI fixes. Not only that, but Microsoft is thought to be working on decoupling the UI elements from the rest of the OS even further, so we should probably see more improvements more quickly. Source: <a href="https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/state-of-the-windows-how-many-layers-of-ui-inconsistencies-are-in-windows-11/">State of the Windows: How many layers of UI inconsistencies are in Windows 11? – NTDEV</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conclusion of this excellent article about Windows 11 UI design inconsistencies is a bit off compared to the rest of the article. You really have to have a look for yourself. Windows, as it is shipping today, contains a plethora of previous-generation UI design languages, all packed together. When I look at macOS, I fail to find any similar example.  Now, my question: why can Apple change everything in the UI (like when they introduced macOS BigSur) and not keep old UI designs? What is Apple doing differently? Is macOS easier to maintain than Windows? Or is it because Microsoft simply doesn&rsquo;t care enough?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Jason Snell reacting to an article on Bloomberg about a possible new development for the Mac in 2025: touchscreen. I&rsquo;m unfazed about this rumour at all. Touching the screen will probably represent 10%-20% of user interaction use cases, while the touchpad or the mouse will grab the rest.</p>
<p>There is one thing that I wonder if it would be possible: can you imagine the macOS UI reacting to the finger coming closer to the screen without actually touching it, something along the lines of the hover gesture with the latest iPad and the Apple Pencil? That could be interesting to watch. Apple will need to increase the size of UI elements, right now, many things are way too small to interact with the fingers. So yeah, the Mac is getting closer to the iPad.</p>
<p>One last thing: I would have thought that Apple would start with the iMac instead of a MacBook Pro, though. The bigger screen and the lack of a touchpad on the iMac would make the touchscreen a helpful option.</p>

Other than that, it is expected to be a quiet year for Apple, helping to set the stage for a focus on the headset. BYW, the updated Mac Pro, a niche product, won’t make much noise in the grand scheme of things. What else will bring noise on the line? The iPhone 15 switching to USB-C? Then what? Nothing that I can think of.</p>

<p>With the introduction of an always-on display in the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, many users have wondered how much impact the feature has on battery life. A new video takes a careful look at just how much battery drain there is with the always-on display and whether turning off the wallpaper reduces that drain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>

<p>it was found that by having the wallpaper enabled for the always-on display, an iPhone 14 Pro will drain around 0.8% per hour, compared to 0.6% an hour for the wallpaper disabled on the always-on display.

<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised by these results. My wife always told me she wouldn&rsquo;t buy a car with a touchscreen-only dashboard. Not only that is the fact that it is far less secure to use a touch screen simply because we need to look at the screen for a long period of time, diverting our attention to what is happening in front of us.</p>
<p>My gut feeling is that, eventually, we will return to a hybrid model when screens have to cohabit with physical dials and buttons. I&rsquo;m paying close attention to what Apple will do in that space. The next generation of CarPlay that we got to see last June at the WWDC conference points in the wrong direction. But who am I to judge, you might ask!</p>

			 <p>If reports and rumors about Apple’s upcoming products this years are to be believed, 2023 looks to be pretty boring.

What worries me is that Apple’s Reality Pro (what a weird and uninspired name) becomes a resources draining hole within the company for a product that is so niche.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m 99% sure to upgrade to the iPhone 15 Ultra. The next possibility is the 15-inch MacBook Air.</p>

I want to focus in 2023, that’s why it is a challenge. That said, creating an instance to ease the adoption of Mastodon with a simple setup and sign up procedure is clever.</p>

			 <p>Editing the framing of a photo in Apple Photos.app is tricky. Initial framing suggested by Photos.app is always tight compared to the maximum possible. I generally prefer to relax Apple’s assumptions here. This is something important when working with relatively low resolution images at 12 MP, the native resolution of my iPhone 13 Pro.</p>

			 <p>In recent months, we’ve seen the addition of many AI-based features in apps like Notion and Craft, two apps that I know pretty well. Now I’m wondering if it would be a good idea that Apple integrates such features at the operating system level. Just like we can double tap a word in a text and get its definition from the dictionary, wouldn’t be cool if we could select a whole text and ask for a summary or anything involving the selected content? Apple would have to decide which AI sources to use or provide users a choice, just like for search engines. Any apps manipulating text would instantly benefit from this added capabilities. Your thoughts?</p>

			 <p>Which platform is best for photographer between Flickr and Twitter if you have about the same number of followers on both? You might think it’s Flickr? According to <a href="https://thomashawk.com/2022/12/twitter-vs-flickr-a-view-count-comparison.html">this experiment</a>, you get 2x more exposure on Twitter, but you get 2x more engagement on Flickr. Things get even better on Flickr if your photo gets selected for Flickr Explore page.</p>
<p>The “views” count definition is not clear but I would think that Twitter’s definition is a wide one (I don’t trust them for being honest about anything). A tweet could get a view count if it goes through an API without guarantee of human actually seeing the picture.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer engagement over views. This is something to expect I guess from a photo-sharing service like Flickr or Glass. Finally, this is an indication of Twitter being an empty promise for photographers.</p>

It’s like when Russia was preparing to break Ukrainian borders last February. Who knows what they’re up to? We shouldn’t trust them. Are these military exercises like they said? My fingers are crossed.</p>
<p>If Russia tries to take Kyiv a second time, I hope the Ukrainian army is ready. They are probably exhausted by months of defensive combats on the south and eastern sides. How will the international community react if Belarus is again used to attack Ukraine?</p>

			 <p>Earlier this year, back in May I think, I started a subscription to Write.as. Why? I was curious about this platform for writers and there was a special for a five-year subscription. So, why not! Then I started to write about my reactions to the war in Ukraine. I wrote maybe a dozen of posts on this subject. I had to let go my feelings. Then I stopped. But I still follow the news about this senseless war. I’m still in state of mixed feelings ranging from feeling helpless, frustrated, desperate, raging, etc.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t know what to do. Should I continue writing on Write.as or move my written frustrations elsewhere? Here? I don’t know. Enabling posts import to my timeline from the Write.as <a href="https://write.as/numericcitizen/feed/">RSS feed</a> might be a good solution.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think about dilemma.</p>

			 <p>I think it is essential to elaborate on why I will close my Twitter accounts in 2023. This is not something to do lightly. So, after much thought, here are my five main reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>I disagree with the values and views as they are expressed by its new owner: Elon Musk. Even if he resigns, it won’t matter much. Elon Musk has broken too many things since he became the owner. Twitter is a broken platform and cannot be trusted.</li>
<li>I no longer want to feed the beast (user tracking, advertising networks, algorithm-based timelines). I won’t pay to get rid of 50% of the ads or whatever Musk decides to ask for.</li>
<li>I no longer trust Twitter’s sustainability and ability to thrive in the future. Twitter has become a loser in my digital landscape. If anything, Twitter has become the other wake-up call for the toxicity of a centralized web. The time has come for decentralizing the Internet.</li>
<li>Twitter doesn’t add significant unique value to my digital life anyway. Most of what I’m getting from Twitter can be found elsewhere.</li>
<li>Before I decided to close my accounts, I wanted to focus on one of my two accounts anyway (numericcitizen) instead of apple_observer, but it doesn’t have enough traction to warrant the efforts for the change.</li>
</ol>
<p>What are your reasons?</p>

			 <p>On Twitter, you can get notified when someone starts following you. Sounds great until it isn&rsquo;t. You know, many people will start following others to get attention about their existence, hoping to get a follow back. It&rsquo;s easy to know they are seeking your attention because after a few days they will unfollow you. I always despised this behaviour. For this reason, I prefer Micro.blog&rsquo;s lack of notifications when someone starts to follow me. I don&rsquo;t pay attention.</p>

It will also likely include a MagSafe charging port, upgraded speaker system, and a 1080p camera.

<p>This year, as an M1 MacBook Air owner, I decided to skip the M2 MacBook Air. The differences aren&rsquo;t significant enough for me to upgrade, performance and design-wise. But getting a bigger display in a light package without going to the Pro line is a different story. It won&rsquo;t come cheap, for sure. Count me in the line up.</p>

			 <p>Exit plans are important. My Twitter exit planning reminds me that we all should have some sort of exit plan for anything we use and depend on online. Every building has an emergency exit plan. Businesses who subscribe to cloud-based services need to plan their exit in case they no longer like their cloud provider. The same should be planned for using services like Twitter. Having a plan is one thing but maintaining it is quite another. I’m learning my lesson the hard way my friends. More to come soon.</p>

			 <p>After much thinking and due to recent events on Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter, I&rsquo;m starting to put together a plan for phasing Twitter out of my digital life entirely. The journey will be long, and I made it to be one of my goals for 2023.</p>
<p>Twitter is well entrenched in my digital life. One example of this is the Mailbrew service that I&rsquo;m subscribing to: sign in requires my Twitter account. Duh. Lots of generated newsletter content is pulled off Twitter. Duh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to be methodical in pursuing a better digital world. I&rsquo;ll learn a lot about along the way and probably reconsider many aspects of my digital workflows.</p>
<p>From now on, I&rsquo;ll use the &ldquo;Qwitter&rdquo; category for these posts.</p>

			 <p>I read about so many people flocking to Mastodon, leaving Twitter behind. I actually started to see a definitive decline in my followers number. Something is really going on. I myself started to think about the possibility of leaving the platform too. Just like I did with Facebook, Flickr, and Tumblr, only to leave a place where my content is simply cross-posted from another source without a real and active presence of mine. Twitter could be next. Really. I could live without the traffic influx from Twitter, which represents about 15% of all my visitors.</p>
<p>There is one thing that it would be hard for me to leave behind, though. If it wasn’t about the war in Ukraine, it would be an easy decision. The problem is that I follow a few people and news sources that diffuse their content on Twitter. Is there a Twitter equivalent for this type of small blips of nano content? I don’t see that in Mastodon yet. RSS feeds are not a platform but transport. The next Twitter has yet to emerge.</p>

<p>There we have it, a new iPad, a new iPad Pro, joining a growing and more confusing iPad lineup than ever. I won’t repeat the best comments from MacStories (“<a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-strange-new-ipad-and-ipad-pro-lineup/">Apple Announces Strange New iPad and iPad Pro Lineup</a>“) and Six Colors (“<a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/10/the-ipads-erratic-odyssey-continues/">The iPad’s erratic odyssey continues</a>”). How are this week’s announcements influencing my buying decisions?</p>
<p>I’m currently using a 2018 11-inches iPad Pro. Going to the 2022 M2 iPad Pro would be a significant step, at least from a processing power perspective. Should I stay on the 11-inches size or go to the 12.9-inches version and get a big screen upgrade? Using this new iPad as a photo-processing machine and as a second screen to any of my Mac would undoubtedly support the bigger iPad. But what a weird setup this would make to use a much-better secondary screen like the 12.9-inches iPad Pro on a 2020 M1-based MacBook Air machine. There is no comparison to be made.</p>
<p>In its video clip of fewer than five minutes, Apple is positioning the latest iPad Pro weirdly and surprisingly: the best machine to experience the “exciting” Stage Manager. What a strange way to present the iPad Pro. It will undoubtedly help but having to buy an expensive iPad to get a different and questionable way to multitask on a tablet is doubtful.</p>
<p>Oh, and what a missed opportunity to have Freeform ready simultaneously and present it as the best way to collaborate in a creative environment! We will have to wait until “later this year” to come to get a sense of Apple’s vision of collaborative work. Oh, and Final Cut is still MIA. Instead, Apple continues to rely on third-party apps to show how powerful the iPad Pro actually is. Thanks to DaVinci Resolve or Affinity, when they ship their new beast of software. Later. Eventually.</p>
<p>I don’t know why but my feeling is that the 2022 iPad Pro is only a transition machine, and the real deal will be next year’s update. Oh, and these keyboard choices are as strange as all the rest.</p>
<p>I’m unsettled. 🤔</p>

<p>The Adobe Max conference was held this week. With each conference comes a slew of new application update releases. I’m not really into Adobe ecosystem except for using Adobe Lightroom on the Mac and the iPad Pro. This is my main photo processing engine, coupled with the excellent Pixelmator Pro. For About a year, Adobe spent some of its development money to “augment” Lightroom, a photo-processing application, with video-processing features. Why? I don’t get it. I don’t want it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom/video-editing.html">As Adobe is adding video-processing features to Lightroom</a>, I fear they are making it less focused and slowly becoming a bloated piece of software, on the outside but also the inside. Adobe Lightroom’s mission was to start over and make a new solid foundation apart from its aging Adobe Lightroom Classic.</p>
<p>I want Adobe to focus on photography; they already have video-processing apps like Adobe Premiere!</p>
<p>I’d love Adobe to focus on making the camera feature compete with a dedicated camera app like Apple’s camera app or Halide or Camera+. I cannot remember when the last release of Adobe touched this portion of Lightroom in significant ways. Why is it important? As a subscriber of an Adobe photography plan, I would use the Lightroom camera more, and my images would directly go to the Adobe Cloud, just like the Apple camera app saved photos in iCloud. It would be so much more convenient. I prefer Adobe cloud for my RAW images instead of having to transit my RAW photos through the Apple Photos library. The more Adobe improves the built-in camera module of Lightroom, the more I’ll stay within Lightroom while in a photography moment.</p>

<p>This podcast example about a fake interview between Joe Rogan and Steve Jobs is a blatant example of where some more thoughts should take place before putting high tech to work. What is the purpose of this? Is this a tech demo or some bad-taste proof-of-concept? It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine how it could derail in the future when used in politically-heated contexts. Oh, and no, I didn’t waste my time listening to this garbage, and I won’t share the link to this podcast, either.</p>

<p>As I write this, rumours are pointing to an imminent release of some updated iPads today. What is novel this time is not the CPU to be used, the screen attributes, or the long-awaited app called Freeform. What is novel is the fact that there won’t be an Apple event for the announcement but a few well-crafted press releases. Apple judges the updates as not worth tech pundits’ time, flight to Cupertino, or even a secret press briefing.</p>
<p>I would argue that we are officially entering the iPad commodity era. Thanks to Apple, who neglected to show the iPad’s true potential with a ported version of powerful apps like Final Cut Pro, a real multitasking experience, the iPad is becoming a mundane device. Putting an M2 processor in it won’t change the story here. Freeform, a low-profile app that Apple quickly demonstrated at the WWDC conference last June, won’t probably appeal to many, being late in the game of collaborative work and creativity. Even long-time bloggers and iPad believers like Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/alright-you-wore-me-down-give-me-macos-on-an-ipad/">are no longer waiting</a> for the iPad to ignite the personal computing segment.</p>
<p>We will see shortly if Apple has a few surprises in-store today.</p>

			 <p>In case you didn’t know, I’m a big fan of Apple (from the corporation, the products to the company’s history). Here’s a little secret: I maintain a document of possible upgrade paths for all my current Apple products. It’s fun. Yes, I’m a bit crazy.</p>
<p>Each year, during the fall, Apple releases a slew of new products. Each year, I spend some time updating my document to reflect my analysis of possible product upgrades. Take the iPhone for example. I’m currently using last year’s iPhone 13 Pro. I’m super happy with but I’m pondering the idea of upgrading to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. So, I list all the reasons why I should do it and all the reasons why I should refrain from doing the upgrade. It’s the same drill for my aging 2018 11-inches iPad Pro. Or my Apple Watch Series 6. It’s quite fun and educative because for each product, I spend quite some time studying it and pondering their technical advances over my current product. It’s really fun. And crazy.</p>
<p>This year, it’s a bit different for some reasons. There’s still nothing in the Apple tech landscape that could trigger a purchase. Not yet. <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/qwrtsQCOFp2eCH">Rumours</a> about an upcoming iPad Pro refresh and a more powerful Mac mini with an M2 are aplenty. Things could change in a few weeks.</p>
<p>But, seriously, what is more fun than anything else is the waiting game. Pleases come while waiting for something to happen. I read somewhere that people who wait patiently to get something are more happy in life than those who succumb rapidly to fill their immediate needs. I must be quite happy then.</p>

			 <p>🇺🇦It is becoming clear that Russians are angry about the near collapse of their army in south and east Ukraine. The strategy now seems to bomb all over Ukraine, mostly civilian infrastructures, to terrorize the civil population, double down with Belarus, and get ready for another take from the north for a second time. They probably hope to disrupt the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south by diverting precious Ukrainian army resources back to the north. Devilish.</p>
<p>Here’s what would be my plan:</p>
<p>First and foremost: <strong>officially declare Russia a terrorist state</strong>. Then:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Apply all possible remaining sanctions against Russia;</p>

<li>
<p>Apply all possible sanctions against Belarus;</p>

<p>Kick out Russia from the Security Council at the UN;</p>

			 <p>A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler/status/1571621859145224192?s=21&amp;t=c3bYMDbcCThf0Ir6XCr2fg">Twitter thread</a> about the possible <strong>iPhone Dynamic Island</strong> inception by Matt Birchler caught my attention a few days ago but couldn&rsquo;t find the required time to write my take.</p>
<p>How long could Dynamic Island have been in gestation at Apple? A few weeks, a few months? I think this has been in the works for quite some time. Besides the visual appearance, the API goes with it and needs a design period too. I&rsquo;m sure Matt understands and knows about that. I would argue that Apple worked on this way before this year&rsquo;s announcement. Best integration between hardware and software takes time because of how Apple is internally structured. Secrecy plays a significant role in making things longer to achieve too. Apple plan&rsquo;s for the long run, and I think the pill shape was set in stone last year.</p>
<p>The second thing that caught my attention is this: How long will Dynamic Island be with us? What if Apple can make the camera disappear under the iPhone&rsquo;s display? Would this make Dynamic Island pointless? No. My take is that the feature is here for the long run, even though the camera and all other sensors could disappear entirely. Apple is training us to accept Dynamic Island as a fundamental part of the iPhone experience. We may even expect the feature to be the de facto standard of the best iPhone user experience. I don&rsquo;t think we will revert to the previous design that Dynamic Island is taking care of. The black pill share could be dynamically removed when not required but could then pop up to respond to the current context dictated by the user interaction.</p>
<p>The Dynamic Island is such a terrible name but the feature in itself is brilliant, so Apple.</p>

			 <p>The way I see it, there is nothing in an updated MacBook Pro line with M2 processors and a tweaked iPad Pro line to warrant a keynote. There has to be something special, really special. iPadOS 16.1, macOS Ventura aren&rsquo;t enough. The rumoured Mac Pro? Maybe, but no signals on its imminent release either. An updated Apple TV hardware? Nah. A larger MacBook Air (like 15&quot;)? Why now? That is why I agree with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/25/new-ipads-macs-press-release-october-event/">Gurman&rsquo;s view</a> and the next product release will go through a set of press releases later in October.</p>

<p>This blog post triggered the following thoughts.</p>
<p>The movement to subscriptions in the software landscape is MASSIVE but is far from being a guarantee of more frequent updates from the developers. I&rsquo;m utterly infuriated when I see a yearly subscription for a small utility with a limited scope when no &ldquo;lifetime&rdquo; options are offered with reasonable pricing. Many devs are lazy, and greedy and send you a big middle finger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the most substantial iPhone redesign since the X. It’s hard to understate how big a change this is. For a reference point, Samsung hasn’t changed their phone architecture since 2015.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So, with the biggest update in years, we’re upgrading the iPhone 14 to a repairability score of 7 out of 10. That’s the best score we’ve given an iPhone since the iPhone 7. This is the most repairable iPhone in years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who wrote that smartphones, iPhone in particular, have peeked? A fundamental redesign of the iPhone to make it more repairable seems not only a good move but a much-needed change of thinking. If Apple is serious about environment protection and carbon footprint, they not only have to think about the choice of materials but also the way iPhones are built so they are more easily fixed. Kudos to Apple. Why this design is only for the iPhone 14, not the Pro, is a mystery to me.</p>

<p>So, I’ve been testing iOS 16 since its early beta stage, and I love it so much. One of the best features is the customizable Lock Screen. But it also creates an issue, the same with Apple Watch watch faces: how to decide which widgets to use and place in those limited slots. There are more and more widgets available each day, but the space is so constrained. I cannot find a strategy to create a Lock Screen that I’m fully satisfied with. I end up creating many of them, but switching among them isn’t smooth, except if they are linked to a focus mode. It’s not a first-world problem, but it is annoying. I’m left with a sense of constant dissatisfaction.</p>

I have some observations to share from my experience.</p>
<p>After spending three weeks in Italy for vacation, from what I could see, there was a lot of iPhone around me independently of the place I visited. Sure I saw many Android phone users too. But a majority were iPhone users. Regarding Android&rsquo;s relative popularity in Germany and France, I would consider the possibility of an aversion for what Apple represents (an &ldquo;American icon&rdquo;) in those countries as a partial explanation. Maybe it&rsquo;s not cool to support an American company like Apple?</p>
<p>Another interesting fact: WhatsApp is THE messaging service app people seem to use the most. iMessage isn&rsquo;t popular in Italy, it seems.</p>

<p>I paid a quick visit to the Apple Store yesterday to get a pack of AirTags and give another look at the M2 MacBook Air, especially the Midnight colour version. In principle, this colour is gorgeous, but in practice, I don’t think I would go with this colour if I were to upgrade to the M2 MacBook Air. It’s really a fingerprints magnet. I know my fingers can be “oily” at times, which would be even worse than in this picture. I like the idea of having black keyboard keys on a dark frame (like the MacBook Pro). Too bad. Another reason to postpone any upgrade plans.</p>

I&rsquo;m leaving for Italy in a few days. Knowing how bad the airport experience can get and reading those stories about airline companies&rsquo; inability to keep up and keep losing track of customers’ luggage, AirTags can make a big difference. I&rsquo;m going to double-down on AirTags. I already own four, and I&rsquo;ll buy another four before leaving, so I get my base covered. AirTags already saved me a lot of trouble in the past on more than one occasion by reminding me that I left something behind. It&rsquo;s well worth the money.</p>

			 <p>A recent <a href="https://merecivilian.com/fast-internet/">post from MereCivilian</a> about subscribing to a fast Internet service triggered this one. Here are a few reasons for having fast Internet at home:</p>
<pre><code>1. You’re many people (four or more) living under the same roof who are active Internet users;
2. You’re many users who are doing streaming at the same time;
3. You’re downloading or uploading really big files all the time;
4. You’re playing online games;
</code></pre>
<p>Other than that, high-speed internet is useless as each micro-transaction (small HTTPS requests) won’t benefit from the bandwidth available. In other words, a 100K web page on a 100 Mbits or 400 Mbits or 1000 Mbits link will take about the same time to load and render within your browser. Finally, consider the DNS service, which plays a big role in the latency involved while browsing the Internet.</p>

Since I&rsquo;m not active on Facebook or Instagram but have a SmugMug and Glass account, what will I do? My Glass and SmugMug accounts aren&rsquo;t for photo journaling, after all.

What about posting here, on Micro.blog, using Sunlit? Decision, decision, decision. 🤔</p>
<p>But, fundamentally, who cares about my trip to Italy? 😉</p>

			 <p>🇺🇦 It’s been a long time since I posted something here. This morning, <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/national/the-battle-to-end-the-war-ukraine-has-a-chance-to-win-initiative-from-russia">an article</a> from the Kyiv Independent brought me into a cheerful mood regarding the conflict in Ukraine. There is something wrong with Russia’s army capabilities right now which looks like an opportunity window for the west. Are we going to take advantage of it? What kind of winter do we want for the Ukrainians? I hope the war fatigue doesn’t take over and obliterate this window of opportunity. Summer will come to an end; we’ll be back from vacations and return to the news watching, hopefully. Eventually, we, the west, will have to up (again) our support game if we want to give a bright future to the Ukrainian people and the rest of the western world. 🙏</p>

			 <p>🇺🇦 When reading about the war raging in Ukraine, there is so much to read, see and… digest. As it has become the focus of my attention from a news consumption perspective since the start of the invasion, I tend to talk about it with my surroundings. I think they are starting to feel the war fatigue. They look at me with rolling eyes 🙄, wondering why I focus so much on what’s happening in Ukraine. Now, here’s the question: who’s at fault here? 🧐</p>
<p>I feel sad about our reactions to this mess. It’s a major issue that will occupy the political, economic and world hungriness for quite some time. Most of these will have some sort of impact on us, individually. We should care and stop turning this war into just another war we don’t have control over. We do.</p>

<p>Special mentions for those who participate in letting this happen again: French president Macron for telling us, seriously, that we shouldn’t humiliate Russia, the Turkish president for trading Ukraine loves to advance his political agenda, Hungary&rsquo;s president for being too close to Russia and finally Switzerland&rsquo;s president who refuses to help Ukraine with weapons.</p>

<p>Recently, during a discussion in a meeting at work, a colleague of mine was expressing his frustration about the fact that one of our customers was using Macs in its business. He went on saying the Mac is such a pain to manage and is an immature platform in the business world compared to Windows PC. I couldn&rsquo;t help myself to tell him he couldn&rsquo;t be farther than the truth.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: of course, management tools and services are aplenty on the Windows platform. Why is that? Well, because it needs so much attention, so they can keep working! Just think of security-related software needed to keep hackers away from your machine full of security holes, thanks to Windows.</p>
<p>It was a “🙄” moment for sure. I think I’m on earth on a mission: to debunk false perceptions about the Mac.</p>

I typically do that myself. This year, though, I’ll skip the whole thing. Apple’s core operating systems are mature, low-hanging fruits are scarce. At this maturity stage, it seems that expressing our desires is more and more a matter of preferences, or interpretation of what could be better user experiences. I may sound bored. Maybe I am. Sure, I’d like improvements to the iPad like full external monitor support, but then what? Apple owns the agenda, decides how to move the needle and protect its bottom line.

<p>Some weeks are busier than others for software or service updates. This week saw meaningful updates to many applications that I used daily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Craft</strong> version got bumped to 2.2, a controversial update. Using the updated Share Page feature, <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/dxwb0SsrGtPF47">my Craft wish list</a> was completely reworked. According to the Craft community channels on Slack, people would rather prefer to see the core experience to be refined and straighten up. I&rsquo;m one of them. It seems to me that there are many unfinished core features within Craft that are in need of attention. For example, the Share Page is super useful but we still miss the use of custom domain names or notifications from people who post comments. It&rsquo;s not a deal-breaker but it is annoying and frustrating.</li>
<li><strong>Matter</strong>, the new kid on the block in the read-later service space was updated too. The team behind Matter made a decision to focus more the product by dropping the social portion of it. Good move. The new update makes a lot of sense and is a joy to use on all Apple platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong> updated the beta version of <strong>Teams</strong> for Apple Silicon, latest public build May, 19th. Previous release provided a very buggy in-conference experience. According to people on Reddit, it seems to be fixed. I didn’t try it yet.</li>
<li><strong>Apple’s platforms</strong> received a slew of updates. I was eagerly awaiting the <strong>Studio Display 15.5 firmware</strong>. I did a comparison of the image quality that I <a href="https://twitter.com/apple_observer/status/1526523351304269826?s=20&amp;t=lomkGe8c7I3n9z4aPiNDTg">posted on Twitter</a>. It’s not perfect but it’s a noticeable upgrade. Some <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/05/19/studio-display-155-update-minimally-improves-camera-and-performance">more detailed video</a> on the update.</li>
<li>Finally, I wanted to mention something about <strong>Glass</strong>. It wasn’t updated this week, but I had a chance to sit with the team behind Glass in a Zoom Q&amp;A session. It was a nice talk. We had a chance to voice our delights or wishes for where the product should go next.</li>

			 <p>The ability to choose the <strong>tools</strong> you use in your job make a big difference. It’s true for surgeons who select the best tools for each task, sometimes going as far as using custom-made instruments. It’s also true for car mechanicians who often bring their toolset from place to place their work.</p>
<p>For me, being able to be fully invested in <strong>the Apple ecosystem</strong> for my job is a must. I wouldn’t want to be forced to use a Windows machine or an Android phone. I would rather move to another job instead. Salary, vacations, or insurance aren’t the only incentives for working for one company or another.</p>
<p>I might sound obvious here, but this was my thought for today anyway.</p>
<p>Are you lucky enough to be able to choose?</p>

			 <p>If I summarize what we saw today from Moscow, it was a smoke &amp; mirrors show. Even Putin’s speech was a letdown, and I felt uninspired. He used fake news to justify the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. He didn’t do what the West was afraid of declaring conscription or a full-out war with Ukraine. He didn’t because he probably knew that he couldn’t. Declaring a war would have been a sign of failure of the “special military ops”. Conscription wouldn’t bring combat-effective resources soon enough anyway. Russia is simply failing at so many levels.</p>
<p>Again, for me, and probably for many military pundits, Russia is showing a pale version of its past. We shouldn’t be afraid of them. And we must keep the pressure on them so that when they lose, they will remember their losses for a long time.</p>

<p>First, I got back to Pocket and paid for the subscription. Then I added Readwise. Then I found Matter, and fell in love with it. I’m not sure why. I’m still waiting for Readwise Reader application. While waiting for it, what’s the point of Readwise, again? News Explorer is my go-to application for most of my readings via RSS feeds; I can save links as favourites, but I never do so. My reading workflow is in a total state of flux.</p>
<p>Which application or service should I use to bookmark articles that I want to read later? What should I prioritize in such application: organization of links or the reading experience? How is that fact that I collect more than I read should change my application selection? Comparing applications like <strong><em>Matter</em></strong>, <strong><em>Pocket,</em></strong> and <strong><em>Raindrop.io</em></strong>, I find many common features, which brings confusion to me. Matter seems better for reading, but Raindrop.io more complete at organizing links collections. Why can’t I have both in the same application? Craft is my goto application for drafting and writing my articles, but can save links with nice previews. Craft is lacking tags to organize objects and doesn’t offer a reading experience as it doesn’t save content from a link. Craft is of no help here in my reading workflow. And what about highlights, how do I create them and make use of them later? Matter is good at creating highlights, Raindrop.io recently added highlight support too, but that’s it. Oh, and RSS readers like Reeder or News Explorer can save links and add tags too. Finally, I wish I could find a great text highlighting extension for Safari, after all, it’s my goto browser.</p>
<p>To some degree, read later applications or services are still maturing, no solution is complete. This explains that, I guess.</p>

<p>I’m back on Telegram, after closing my account about a year ago. I wrote about the reasons why on <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/05/19/im-closing-my.html">my story published on Micro.blog</a>. Since the start of the criminal invasion of Ukraine by the Russian, I found out quickly that a lot of information about the conflict is being published on Telegram. I decided to come back and open a new account.</p>
<p>I read on Mr. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/pavel-durov/?sh=6d0bbb9f14c5">Pavel Durov</a>, the founder of Telegram. Some compare him to Elon Musk. He&rsquo;s opinionated, just like Musk. He has his views on Apple and technology. He seems to advocate user privacy protection. Furthermore, he flew from Russia because <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2022/03/07/telegrams-billionaire-founder-says-hes-never-provided-ukrainians-data-to-russia/">he refused to cooperate with the government</a>, which was asking to leak information from Telegram users.</p>
<p>A few words on Telegram, my usage, its design and the application. It’s available on most of the Apple platforms, including the Mac. I like its design a lot. I don’t use it for chatting, only to receive messages from channels where comments aren’t enabled.</p>
<p>Only fools don’t change their mind.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://thenewsprint.co/2022/03/28/keeping-a-separate-creativity-computer/">recent article from Josh Ginter</a> for The Newsprint, If found the idea of having a separate computer for work and one for creative activities interesting and I’m close to feeling the same about my personal and work life. I do most of my work on an M1 Mac mini, while my creative work is done on an M1 MacBook Air. My iPad is used as a second screen on my Mac mini or for some photo processing stuff with Adobe Lightroom. The distinction between two worlds gets blurry when you consider how the cloud brings those two worlds closer to each other. If you are like me and use a single Apple ID for all your Apple services, as soon as you set up iCloud on both computers, you’ll get access to the same “virtual space and digital content” on both machines. This is where the idea of two separate computers becomes blurry and probably more of a theory.</p>

On the subject of iPadOS, looking at <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/142096789/iPadOS-Updates">this article</a> on Behance from Parker Ortolani, here are the few interesting ideas that caught my attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>The updated Dock with the ability to move an application window to an external display.</li>
<li>Still on the Dock, the frequently used applications replaced with standard folders (like downloaded items).</li>
<li>Stacks in the Dock, just like on macOS.</li>
<li>Home Screen icon placements can include things like Shortcuts, or files.</li>
<li>Studio Mode for external display full support. My number one request.</li>
<li>Addition of Preview from macOS would be super useful for more pro-like workflows. Same with the addition of Dictionary. It would be super useful for content creators like me.</li>
</ul>
<p>WWDC 2022 is around the corner, starting another round of updates for iPadOs over the coming year.</p>

<p>I recently came back from a one-week vacation in Cancun, Mexico. The first thing I did before leaving the airport to go home was to call an Uber taxi. My last experience with Uber went well, but it was quite a while. Boy, this time it was a surprising and unexpected experience. After ordering the car, I was met with a plethora of notifications and ads within the application and via Uber Eat to order food on the go or before arriving at home. Those ads took the form of notifications, but also big popups taking the whole screen within the application. It was so intrusive, it wasn’t always clear how to dismiss the ad to return to the actual trip details.</p>
<p>I understand the idea of integrating two different services from the same company, but doing so at the expense of a great user experience with the basic feature of the application is not the way to go with me. Even Apple sometimes seems to be going in that direction. Not good.</p>

<p>Now that <a href="https://numericcitizen-introspection.blog/friday-notes-69-a-new-home-office/">I’m finally having my dedicated room in the house for working</a>, I’m wondering about returning to podcasting (I used to have a podcast, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/numeric-citizen-podcast/id1447782157">in French</a>) or even testing the YouTuber world (even though I wrote in the past that <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/12/22/ill-never-be-a-youtuber-here-is-why/">I’ll never be a YouTuber</a>). Why is that?</p>
<p>First, a dedicated room is mandatory to be able to record without being disrupted too much. Second, sound quality would probably be much better than recording in an open space. Third, I could create a better background because my room is decorated to my personal tastes.</p>
<p>But is this enough to convince myself to seriously consider getting back to audio or video content creation? I have all the tools: a great MacBook Air, a Mac mini, an Apple Studio Display, a good microphone, a NAS for archiving purposes, etc. Yet, I’m not really good at audio or video production, and it’s very time-consuming for me. I would certainly learn a lot while working hard at this. Moreover, should I do this in my native language which is French or do it in English, which I’m not perfectly fluent with? Maybe I could try to do it together with other podcasters (I know a few of them). Too many questions, not many answers.</p>

			 <p>🇺🇦 It’s fascinating how the <strong>war in Ukraine</strong> makes me think about many video games. Let me explain. Looking at some <em><strong>Telegram</strong></em> <em><strong>channels</strong></em> feeding the results of attacks with anti-tank missiles or other means. You’ll find many short video clips with music and animation while a tank is destroyed. It makes things look like they aren’t real, only a game, which is far from the case for obvious reasons. Yet, there is the <strong>gamification</strong> of some aspects of what is filtering out of this ugly and devastating war. 😟</p>
<p>BTW, many tidbits flowing on Telegram are utterly disgusting. Is this the first war to feel so close to the action?</p>
<p>When the coalition attacked Iraq during the Gulf War, I remember people saying it was the first war to be televised. The war in Ukraine is probably the first one made public on social media.</p>

			 <p>This morning while reading the news, I suddenly remembered about <strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>. He’s still alive, which I didn’t know. His birthday was March 2th. He’s 92. I vividly remember his presidency and what he brought to Russia and the world. One big and hard lesson we’re currently learning is that we cannot take anything for granted regarding democracy. Does he know what’s happening in Ukraine? What’s his take on all this shit? I would love to see him in an interview. He certainly wasn’t perfect, but Russia seemed to have a much more prevalent “human side” under his tenure. Under Putin, I just want to puke. 🤮</p>

			 <p>🧐⁉️ It’s surprising to see European countries’ weak stance against Russia and the dire situation in Ukraine. I mean, world war II is not that far in history after all. Doesn’t Germany remember anything from fascism or Hitler? What about Austria? Their inaction speaks for themselves. I would have thought they would be more proactive in supporting Ukraine and trying to prevent another European war, if not another world war. What will it take to make them change their action cadence? 😮</p>

			 <p>Thanks to MacRumors, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/04/apple-apology-to-mac-pro-users-five-years-ago/">as reported today</a>, I didn’t know today was the fifth anniversary of a special meeting between Apple’s top brass and select journalists to talk about Apple’s plans with the pro users and their commitment to the Mac.</p>
<p>At the time, we didn’t know how serious Apple’s upcoming pivot would be. In retrospective, Apple delivered and then some. It is simply a tour-de-force to flip the Mac product line upside down and bring power efficient, mighty and beautiful Mac designs. The Mac transition to Apple Silicon is probably the most important change to come to the Mac line since its inception in 1984.</p>

I found an old bank account statement where I can see a withdraw transaction to help me pay for my <strong>Macintosh 128K</strong> in 1985: 3460.75 CAN$. 🤑 Ouch. I did some research to better document the time when I had a <strong>Macintosh SE</strong> while studying at the university and remembered about using Think Pascal, Prototyper and ResEdit to build a floppy disks indexer. That was before the Internet. It was so much fun. It’s gives you an idea how old I am. 😜</p>

			 <p>💥Today’s news about a possible <em><strong>attack by the Ukrainian</strong></em> army on Russia’s land is potentially game-changing in this war between Ukraine and Russia. A few thoughts.</p>
<p>First, Russia doesn’t have the exclusive right to use “<em><strong>Special Operation</strong></em>” when referring to war-related actions. Second and more seriously, Who did this? If indeed it is Ukraine, was it to test Russia’s defence? If so, Russia again failed miserably from a military perspective at protecting its territory as, surprisingly, helicopters didn’t face any shots from the ground. Is someone paying attention to the sky in Russia? Another point goes in the column of “weak army.” Mind blown. Or is it that Ukraine wants something else: drag Russia into war and force the West to intervene? Is this scenario too twisted?</p>
<p>What if it is Russia? I wouldn’t be surprised at a deliberate act to help build even more momentum and justify what they are doing against Ukraine. This momentum will be needed when Russia returns on the east front once they finish regrouping and replenishing their units.</p>
<p>The next few hours will be interesting to watch. 📺</p>

<p>It’s March 2022. Spring is finally here. Moreover, among us, <strong>Apple Silicon</strong>, first announced in June 2020 and massively available since November 2020. Furthermore, also available is <strong>Center Stage</strong>, a new feature introduced with the 2021 iPad Pro and now available on the MacBook Pro and more recently the Apple Studio display.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. Microsoft Teams, currently at version 1.5 still isn’t supporting Center Stage and worst, Apple Silicon. Running Teams on any recent Mac is an execrable experience: slow, bad image quality (compared to Zoom for example) and consume far too much memory. How is it possible for a company the size of Microsoft who’s so slow to move and fix Teams? I don’t buy the argument about Teams being built with the Electron framework. The latter already supports the M1 chip. <a href="https://office365itpros.com/2021/06/25/teams-2-webview2-replaces-electron/">Microsoft is supposedly working on Teams version 2.0 which will be presumably built on WebView2</a>. They’ve been working on this since June of last year.</p>
<p>It’s highly frustrating. Sorry for the bad mood, but Teams is one of the most used application for work giving me the right to vent my frustration.</p>

			 <p>🤔 <strong>I’m not a military expert</strong>, far from it, but as we go further into this insane and highly criminal war, facts show there is <strong>something wrong with the Russian army</strong>. Highly exposed and long columns of standing still vehicles, attacking way too many fronts at once, and losing so many soldiers in such a short time frame are good examples that show how amateurish the Russian army is. Russia isn’t a superpower, both military and economically. Rumours are to the effect that missile inventories are at an all-time low. And I’m not even talking about troops’ morale. As much as 75% of the operational army of Russia is supposedly dedicated to the invasion of Ukraine. Only 25% of their active resources are left scattered across Russia. 🇷🇺🔫</p>
<p><em>Russia apparently is failing at their primary military objectives: occupy territory in a sustainable way and seize Ukraine’s leadership.</em></p>

<p>Well, after a promising start, following reviews of the <strong>Apple Studio display</strong>, it seems that I’ll put my buying decision on hold. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2022/03/12/a-peek-at-apples-studio-vision/">As I wrote</a>, one of the reasons why I’m considering this display is the integrated camera and speakers for a better video conference experience. It appears image quality is not good at all, judging by the examples posted online. It’s close to being a deal breaker.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Apple Studio display is running a version of iOS 15.4. Yep, sounds overkill, and yet, it’s the case, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/17/three-updates-regarding-studio-display">according to Gruber</a>. Apple is promising a software update to fix the problem and bring image quality on par with the iPad Pro equipped with the same camera and essentially using th same software to enable Center Stage.</p>
<p>Here’s something: when we look at preview integrated cameras in MacBook Pro or the iMac and find the image quality to be bad, we try to excuse Apple of fitting a camera in a too-thin enclosure. But we know it’s not enough to explain the issue of image quality. Software is the problem. Look no further than the iPhone for an example.</p>
<p>As soon as:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can go to an Apple Store to see the Apple Studio display for myself;</li>
<li>Normal people are publishing their reviews and comment on their experience with the display;</li>
<li>Apple fixes the camera image quality with an update to the display operating system;</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, I’ll make a final decision. Now, I can’t wait to see in action the software upgrade process on this thing.</p>

<p>Benjamin Mayo in <a href="https://bzamayo.com/mac-studio" title="Apple Introduces Mac Studio">Apple Introduces Mac Studio</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…the introduction of a brand new model of Mac is precisely the best time to do something entirely new.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Mac Studio is a boring box with rounded corners, and has no party tricks to speak of. The trashcan was a truly wild, out-there, design.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I share the same sentiment. A new form-factor is a rare thing from Apple. An elongated Mac mini doesn’t do justice the Mac Studio interior, even less to its name. Another missed opportunity. I guess “real pros” doesn’t give a damn about all of this.</p>

			 <p>On March 13th, in 2020, the world flipped, my world flipped. So many things are different now. This short blog post is about reflecting on the last two years and how they became the foundation for what is to come in my life.</p>
<p>Time flies and making judicious decisions is more important than ever. Working from home is important. I’ll never return full time at the office. Even if I move to another job, working from home is now a requirement. Visiting customers for the sake of shaking hands no longer make sense to me. There has to be more than this. The price is too high to pay: wasted time.</p>
<p>Traveling is more important than ever too; that’s the only way for me to do more photography. Something that I didn’t do much in the last two years. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/04/13/confinement-a-visual-essay/">This visual work posted in April of 2020</a> was the trigger to write this blog post. I’m sad about this because photography is my most important source of inspiration and my biggest creativity playground after writing. Still on the travel subject, I can envision traveling abroad for more than two weeks now and splitting my time between leisure and remote work. Leaving for a month or more is now possible.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing, I’ll probably continue to write but probably not as much as in the last two years. A more balanced life is taking place and will take away some of my writing time. It’s ok. It’s also part of making better choices.</p>
<p>The last two years of COVID-19, the more and more frequent climate disturbances and the recent events in Europe are telling me this: the world is more than ever in a constant state of emergency. I better learn how to cope with this otherwise I’m not finished at being in constant consternation mood while reading the news.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this. I know your time is precious too and you made the decision to read this short piece.</p>

He wants to make Russia “great again” but not for his people, for himself. After Ukraine, he will look around and select his next target. And invade. Eventually, he will make a mistake. Either he will pay for it, or we will all pay for it. Mark my words.</p>

			 <p>‼️ 🇷🇺 Current events around the world, triggered by the <strong>criminal invasion of Ukraine,</strong> are setting the stage for <strong>WWIII</strong>. I cannot see how this conflict can continue without forcing more countries to get militarily involved. It could be anything involving another country’s reaction to help before Putin thinks it is an act of war. This criminal is just patiently waiting for it.</p>
<p>The longer the war continues, the more apparent it is to me: we’re not ready to admit it yet, but we are clearly on the path to <strong>the next world war in Europe</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s now official. <strong>Apple</strong> will host another <strong>virtual event</strong> next week, on March 8th. It’s the first Apple event of 2022, but it’s far from being the first real event of 2022. Current events happening in <strong>Ukraine</strong> are troubling and make me pause on a lot of things. Apple-related stuff is one of these. I’m not in the mood for that. My thoughts and energy are diverted, seized. I don’t care if it’s a new iPhone SE, a beefed up Mac mini or whatever else. These look so irrelevant in this incredible and terrible era. Low interest indeed.</p>

Apple’s products are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/01/apple-stops-product-sales-in-russia/">no longer being sold through its online store</a>. While the App Store is still working apparently, I’m ok with their decision. On top of that, Apple will donate money, twice the amount that employees will give to help Ukrainians. It’s a good move, the only move, without using real arms, to make an impact. It’s even more powerful when many companies are doing exactly the same.</p>

I hope time will bring back my willingness to open myself for opportunities and take advantage of them when they present themselves.

			 <p>The news of the Russian criminal invasion of its sovereign neighbour, Ukraine, is appalling. Putin and his regime is committing an aggression that shall be punished, at the right time, at the right place with the right means. I cannot believe that we’re seeing such an invasion in Europe, in 2022. What’s next? Who’s next? We’re all going to suffer at various degrees from this utterly criminal invasion. I pay no respect to Putin, his government, his propaganda machine and every single Russian who support this aggression. This is an act of war against democracy.</p>
<p>No wonder why Ukraine wanted to stay in NATO camp, because Russia is simply an antidemocratic land. Democratic governments and systems are far from perfect, but they are the least imperfect solution.</p>
<p>For now, I’m sending my positive waves of support to the Ukrainians community of Montreal, Canada. I cannot wait for the next demonstration, so I can show my full support of the Ukrainians.</p>

<p>If you own a desktop Mac, you probably use an external drive for <strong>Time Machine</strong>. If you use a portable Mac, most likely not, and according to the Tidbits <a href="https://tidbits.com/2022/01/14/network-time-machine-backups-moving-on-from-the-time-capsule/">article</a>, you’re not alone. The portability of the Mac is hindered by having an external drive hooked permanently. I, personally, have a different strategy: I use a <strong>Synology NAS DS720+</strong> with Time Machine enabled to do my backups over the wireless network. It works perfectly, but I don’t do a full backup of my MacBook Air. Files that are part of iCloud Drive are excluded (<a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2022/02/21/can-you-back-up-icloud-documents/">read more here, you’ll find out why it’s a good idea</a>). In fact, most of the files are excluded, except a few critical folders, outside the scope of any cloud syncing services. Applications aren’t backed up either (easy to recover in case of lost). Backups are small but are just what I need to protect my work.</p>

			 <p>🏢 As my workday is coming to an end, I have a few questions in my mind. The same questions pop up when I take short walks during the day, so I can step back for a few moments and reflect on my current day.</p>
<p>Did I do my best today? Did I help my colleagues to achieve their goals? Did It make a difference? Am I always actively listening? Did I add value to the process? Am I the best one to do this job today, right now? Did I start the right discussion, ask the right questions? Were my answers ok? Complete? 🙇🏻</p>
<p>So many questions.</p>

			 <p>👉🏻 I posted a <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2019/01/12/my-final-post-on-facebook/">farewell letter</a> on my <strong>Facebook</strong> wall before making it inactive for a while. But here is another one that I wish I would have seen before writing mine: &ldquo;<a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2019/01/15/goodbye-facebook.html">Goodbye Facebook</a>&rdquo;. There are a few really good ideas that I should have used myself. One is to set up an email <strong>newsletter</strong> so my friends could get some news from me and from which we could interact. Too bad I didn&rsquo;t think about it. Is it too late? How many of my friends would take the time to get in touch with me and me about my life, what am I up to? Probably not that many.🤨</p>

<p>Even after reading this <a href="https://lux.camera/iphone-13-pro-camera-app-intelligent-photography/">excellent article</a> by the guy behind <strong>Halide</strong>, I’m still mystified by Apple’s <strong>ProRAW</strong> format.

<p>Today, I finally saw the <strong>Dune</strong> movie, by the Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve. As a Canadian myself I’m so proud of him! It’s not a movie review, far from it. Let me just say that when I think about this movie, the word “equilibrium” comes to my mind. The movie is well balanced: storyline, intrigue, visual effects (visual effects serving the story), music, Dune’s world imaginary world. But the best for me were those “ornithopters”. Wow, they were sooooo cool! Can’t wait for the next part.</p>
<p>Have you seen the movie? What do you think of it?</p>

<p>From 1993 to 1994, I owned a PowerBook Duo 210 sporting a trackball, a low-profile keyboard and a grayscale screen. I didn’t like the trackball as the pointing device. The keyboard wasn’t that great either. But, it was small, highly portable. Coupled with the Duo Dock and an external monitor, it was a cool and novel setup. It’s been a long time ago. This article was written using a M1 MacBook Air, in a coffee shop.</p>

<p>Why is <a href="https://www.meetcarrot.com/weather/">Carrot Weather</a> so popular? I’m a <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/02/03/great-weather-apps-for-weather-enthusiasts/">weather enthusiast</a> and I like trying new weather-related applications. I use many all year long, but Carrot Weather is not part of my application arsenal. They recently introduced updated weather maps, but to get a sense of them, I would need to subscribe for a year subscription. Most of the interesting features are available in the premium tier. I like the maps feature, but I wonder how better they will get compared to the ones that I’m already using in MyRadar. iOS 15 brought a significant update to the weather too, but I find the maps lacking radar resolution.</p>
<p>If there are users of Carrot Weather subscription, tell me more, tell my why it is so nice?</p>

Spring still feels far, and December seems like yesterday. The only good part is that daylight increases steadily, and it’s a short month. Oh, TGIF! 🌨</p>

			 <p>👨🏻‍💻 I think it’s important that you know a bit about who’s behind this continuous musing feed. So, here you go.</p>
<p>Dear visitor, welcome to my <strong>write.as</strong> blog. My real name is JF Martin, but I prefer to be called <em><strong>Numeric Citizen</strong></em> in cyberspace. This is my pen name (<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/numericcitizen-nom-de-plume/">learn why I&rsquo;m using this name</a>). I&rsquo;m an IT (Information Technologies) professional since the early nineties. I&rsquo;m 55, <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/friday-notes-53/">I&rsquo;m probably getting old</a>, I know. I have many hobbies, but writing is the one that’s taking up much of my spare time. I spend about twenty hours a week on writing and publishing (fully documented <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/11/04/which-device-i-use-and-for-what/">here</a>). Why? Get the answer in “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/friday-notes-60/">I read, I learn, I write, I Share</a>”. As explained in <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/a-newsletter-about-what/">this post</a>, I write about my passions which are revolving around <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>photography</strong>, <strong>privacy protection</strong> and <strong>climate change</strong>. You&rsquo;ll find plenty of stuff on these subjects in <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/prWu9ohKSgta1T">my digital garden</a> (⚠️ warning: it&rsquo;s a rabbit hole 🐇).</p>
<p>As you can see, I have more than enough interests to trigger my inspiration. So much so that they are the source of <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/tag/newsletter/">my monthly newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>You can find more information about me <a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/about">here</a>. Get to know all my sites with <a href="https://linktr.ee/numericcitizen">Linktr.ee</a>. (think of this as some sort of visitors card)!</p>

			 <p>📚 While looking around me and paying attention to the generation that follows, I see most people on their screen looking at videos (Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, etc.). <strong>I rarely see someone reading on their screen, even less a book</strong>. I find it troubling in a few ways. First, I think people are becoming lazy about getting new knowledge and culture. Second, it’s harder to read than watching videos. Third, attention span has never been this short in the younger generation.</p>
<p>When I write an article with an average read time of more than four or five minutes, I know before hitting the <em>publish</em> button that very few people will read it. Those who do are probably older people. I might be wrong. I hope. 😒</p>

			 <p>🤔 When thinking about <strong>my newsletter subscribers</strong>, I often think about them as being people attending a class or a presentation: each newsletter being some sort of a presentation. According to my recent analytics, 45% of my subscribers read the newsletter. If I continue with the class or presentation analogy, this means more than half of the people who show up don’t even bother listening to what’s I’m saying. 🤨😔</p>
<p>Some writers prefer newsletters instead of having a blog, thinking they have a more personal relationship with their readers by sending them an email. Allow me to think differently. 🤔</p>

Each blog post has to be <strong>short</strong> (less than 400-500 characters), contain <strong>highlighted words</strong> for improved readability, include <strong>tags</strong> at the end, a few <strong>emojis</strong> and optionally a <strong>“Discuss”</strong> link to invite the user to comment. Each of these posts should require less than 10 minutes to write and publish. 🏷</p>

Whatever the reason, adding external links can be time-consuming. My experience (and analytics) show that less than 10% of the visitors will click on them. I wonder if the time it takes to include these links is worth it. <em>Do you visit external links when reading an article or do you find it distracting to do so? 🧐</em></p>

			 <p>Going back in time on previously published content can be the source of a few smiles. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2018/10/13/the-return-of-micro-blogging/">My oldest post</a> on my main blog is about Micro.blog. Here is an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This morning I found out the existence of a blogging platform called Micro.blog. Something very special. Very lean. Very light. Without ads. Leaner than WordPress. Yet capable. Close to Twitter but with less clutter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s funny. It’s not about introducing my blog or something like “hello” world.</p>

			 <p>Well, well, well, it seems that data portability among CMS is an issue. Who knew! I&rsquo;m trying to find an easy way to move a few posts from my <a href="https://numericcitizen.me">WordPress blog</a> into my <a href="https://numericcitizen-introspection.blog">Ghost website</a>. Exporting data from WordPress seems like an all-or-nothing situation. There are a few plugins available for this. The problem is that the content isn&rsquo;t easily imported into Ghost. The latter does have a plugin, but it doesn&rsquo;t support selecting posts. I don&rsquo;t want to do this manually.</p>
<p>Any idea or suggestions?</p>

			 <p>😒 We’re approaching two years of this COVID-19 pandemic. We’re entering a phase where people no longer feel the need to care about COVID-19. <em><strong>I feel that way. I don’t care anymore. I don’t feel guilty about it.</strong></em> When I look at the news, more and more signs of people being fed up are popping up. Our collective energy is now directed at saying out loud how we’re tired of all this instead of making concessions about our liberties to fight some invisible virus. I certainly hope that no other major variant will come to life, requiring another six months of confinement, sanitary rules, and de-confinement. But, unfortunately, I am afraid people are going to resist this time. 😔</p>

<p>According to this year’s <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/02/apple-in-2021-the-six-colors-report-card/">Six Colors Report Card</a>, relationships between Apple and its developers&rsquo; community is in terrible shape. The trend isn’t looking good either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marco Arment said, “Apple’s tightening grip on App Store fees, attempts to reach into other parts of businesses that they don’t deserve, and extremely entitled and galling statements on the matter continue to be distasteful and extremely damaging to their reputation. It seems like a huge strategic blunder to inflame developer relations, generate bad PR, invite more regulatory scrutiny, and risk governments imposing much worse changes for such a small percentage of their revenue.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is Apple still able to read the room temperature, or it is blind because of its financial successes? For once, I think Apple should copy <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/09/open-app-store-principles-activision-blizzard/">Microsoft’s leadership</a>.</p>

<p>As reported in <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2022/01/30/replacing-another-aging.html">my previous blog post</a>, I had a chance to perform a “tech refresh” of my sister’s WiFi installation at her house. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/06/21/replacing-an-airport-extreme-with-unifi-dream-machine/">As a satisfied user of Ubiquiti product</a>, the Dream Machine, I suggested to go with a lower end model, the <strong><em>Amplify HD</em></strong>. She has a big two levels home, with numerous rooms that poses a challenge for good wireless connectivity. It was a delightful experience, from the unpacking to final configuration. It’s a beautiful device with an informative display.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/f1d52704eb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The setup was simple. Turning off the AirPort Express after taking note of the SSID, so I could reuse it with the same password. This prevents the reconfiguration of every device connecting to the WiFi with an already known SSID-password combination. After the initial power up sequence, the router will ask the user to download the configuration application from the App Store. An account has to be created with Ubiquity. Thankfully, Sign In with Apple is available.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/09a8811bed.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The next phase happens on the iPhone with an initial discovery over Bluetooth. The setup process is quick and flawless. As expected, a firmware update was waiting to be applied. During the update process, it was the right rime to deploy the two WiFi extenders, in strategic places where the WiFi signals used to be weak. Once completed, I could name each devices with a more meaningful name, to represent where were each device. All in all, the process took less than 30 minutes. It’s a very Apple-like experience. The following table shows the situation before and after the new router. Numbers speaks for themselves.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9e987d0e1c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Mission accomplished. Another happy customer. I came back with the old AirPort Extreme. No idea what to do with it.</p>

Today, I’m kind of repeating the experience, but this time with the <a href="https://amplifi.com/amplifi-hd">Amplify HD router</a>, also from Ubiquiti, for my sister. Don’t expect a complete review, but expect a post with a few observations. My sister is having weak WiFi issues in her house and I suggested her to get the kit to form a mesh network. I’ll be taking measure before and after to see if it brings meaningful improvements in her big house. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/apple_observer/status/1486422541153423361?s=20">I’m a big fan of Apple’s Sidecar</a>. I frequently use it for work. When Apple announced Universal Control at the 2021 WWDC keynote, I was blown away by the technical challenge it might have represented for Apple’s engineers. It really makes for great demos. Then, I started to wonder if this feature would enable new workflows, and I failed to find meaningful ones. With Sidecar, the iPad acts like a passive device most of the time, and I’m happy with this configuration. Then, following the release of iOS 15.4b1, videos (like <a href="https://youtu.be/V7qhOo_jR2Y">this one</a> from MacRumors) demonstrating Universal Control in action started to pop up. I changed my mind.</p>
<p>Under a Universal Control configuration, the iPad acts like an intelligent extension of the Mac desktop. It’s like Sidecar Pro Max (just kidding here). The iPad becomes a second computing device readily available to the Mac. The user simply and seamlessly can take advantage of this second screen in a matter where the computing power of the device adds up to the Mac, the screen, the system memory. It’s absolutely clever.</p>
<p>I can see myself using Craft on the MacBook Air and Ulysses on the iPad Pro, all using the MacBook’s keyboard and trackpad. Or vice versa. Clever. Really.</p>

<p>Please, stop thinking that a screen on the HomePod mini makes sense because it just doesn&rsquo;t. Why? Well, by looking at where we put these devices in our house, most of the time, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see the screen from a distance. What Apple really wishes is that you buy an iPad mini with a Smart Folio cover for that purpose.</p>

<p>I find it surprisingly hard to find a simple MP3 player for an iPhone these days. I mean, just a simple application capable of downloading an MP3 file locally on the device with good playback controls, simple library management, nothing fancy. <strong><em>Readdle&rsquo;s Documents</em></strong> (which I know very well) and EverMusic seem to be popular options. Documents offers a good user experience, albeit its multipurpose mission with documents management.</p>
<p>(I’m a moderate consumer of Soundcloud (paid subscription) and use Downie to download files from the service. Those files are stored on my DS720+ Synology NAS.)</p>
<p>What’s your experience in playing MP3 files on your iPhone? I’m curious.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m nearly done with my Notion to Craft migration. I know I&rsquo;ve been lazy; I&rsquo;ve been using Craft for many months while my old content was still sitting there in Notion. While doing the migration, I realized, again, that I don&rsquo;t really like Notion&rsquo;s handling of a document. It just feels unnatural and quirky. Export options are very limited, which makes my job much harder. I&rsquo;m also losing some metadata along the way (and database content too). I don&rsquo;t have high hopes for a Craft eXtension to support Notion&rsquo;s API to help users do this kind of rich content migration. I expect to finish the migration in the coming days.</p>

<p>Why try to imagine new solutions to fix the widgets conundrum on macOS? The Dashboard was the only good solution where you could put widgets anywhere on the screen, then invoke them as needed. Dear Apple, are you reading this? 🥺🙏🏻</p>

<p>As you probably know, I’m a big fan of <a href="https://www.craft.do">Craft</a>. This application is really at the center of everything I do online, as thoroughly documented in <a href="https://numericcitizen.io/2021/12/18/my-blogger-workflow-as-of-2021-12">my blogger workflow</a>. That being said, I always keep an eye open for competing services, thanks to my Twitter list “<a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1346445507560960003">Apps &amp; Services</a>”. Notion is one of them. Before Craft, there was Notion, which I loved too. But it felt too complicated or overkill for my needs. Craft is nowhere near Notion in terms of features. There is no comparison, even though <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/03/12/craft-vs-notion-from-a-bloggers-perspective/">I wrote one</a>. Really. Yet, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/NotionHQ">their recent tweets</a>, Notion has been on a roll lately, adding features, tweaking things or rewriting a portion of the user experience like the <a href="https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/1483884489235255297">text editing engine</a>. So, where am I going with this?</p>
<p>It is tempting to think: what if I came back to Notion? I still have my account, after all. Things always look better on the other side of the fence, right? The thing is the speed of evolution of Craft, while being considered at a fast pace by some, I’m realistic, and I would argue the contrary. The team behind Craft is surely a fraction of Notion’s. Basic things are hard to come by. Said another way, my expectations aren’t met as fast as I wished. Take this week’s <a href="https://www.craft.do/whats-new">update,</a> which was released earlier this week. While I’m happy to see improvements, there is not much to talk about. The release notes starts by the possibility to “star” a document, so it is easier to find in the navigation bar on the left. The second thing on the list is some improvements to the display of backlinks at the end of a page. While being welcomed by many, it’s not exactly mind-blowing. Sure it is a dot dot release (v2.0.3), but I was expecting so much more, as documented in my <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/dxwb0SsrGtPF47">Craft wish list</a>. Craft eXtensions, announced with the 2.0 release at the end of 2021 sure looks full of potential, but my expectations lean toward Craft’s core experience, which I find somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>I think I’m being overly demanding. Patience is a virtue.</p>

<p>I always liked electronic music, but I’m not a musician. In recent moths, I’ve been exploring the world of DJing. It’s a way for me to feel that I can do music without deep knowledge of musical theory. It’s a fascinating world.</p>
<p>Last year I bought a Pioneer DDJ-400 controller for use with my Mac mini. There is two major roadblocks in my experience so far: finding good quality tracks to mix and selecting the best DJ app. I want to draw your attention to the software side of my story.</p>
<p>Some well known DJ apps are Rekordbox, Serato and DJay. My understanding is that in recent years, software makers all switched to subscription models. Application like Rekordbox will “unlock” some of its features while being used with certain DJ controller models, but to get the whole thing, you have to subscribe to some plan. It’s irritating for someone like me who’s just trying to learn and experiment. But there is another problem: applications design sucks. Rekordbox and Serato are visually terrible. On the Mac, these apps really feels like aliens coming from… I don’t know… even on Windows they probably look aliens. The best looking application is Algoriddim’s Djay, by far. Problem is, the application is lacking many features. For now, my conclusion is that It appears that we cannot have both fully featured applications with a great design.</p>

<p>Apple finally published the numbers of people who upgraded to iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. While the percentages show the vast majority of users upgraded their devices, there are more people than with previous years who didn’t. It’s probably Apple’s fault.</p>
<p>With iOS 15, Apple is no longer forcing users to adopt the latest release to get the latest security updates. A user running iOS 14.7 can stay there as long as he can apply the security patches made available for that version. It’s an entirely new approach for Apple. I wonder why Apple made that change. I think I found one big reason.</p>
<p>If you compare Apple’s ecosystem to Android, Apple has a clear advantage here by being able to move the needle much faster for releases adoption, until now. In a single year, Apple can transform its ecosystem of users by adding features that are quickly making their way into people’s devices. By allowing users to stay on previous releases, Apple is shooting itself in the foot. Now they seem to change their mind, though. Apple could be changing his mind. As reported by MacRumors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>iOS 15‌ used to be listed as an optional update on devices running iOS 14, but now it is front and center on devices that still have iOS 14, and it is the only available update option as Apple has now stopped making security updates available for devices running iOS 14. Those who want the latest security fixes need to upgrade to ‌iOS 15‌, as all devices capable of running iOS 14 also support ‌iOS 15‌.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s the right move for Apple, since they tend to support old devices longer than other manufacturers. Apple could tweak iOS to be less aggressive is upgrading to the latest release by introducing delays in a random manner. Users eager to upgrade can do so manually, others would randomly get a notification suggesting the availability of the newer release. As time passes, those notifications would increase in frequency. This new behaviour will probably never come to like and not be enough. Here is why.</p>
<p>There might be another reason behind this change of mind on Apple’s part. Look at antitrust regulations looming on the horizon all around the world. Apple is probably making sure that all users adopt the latest release faster to comply with possible new regulations imposed by lawmakers, which would need to trigger changes to the operating system.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009">recent article in the Wall Street Journal</a> created a concerted reactions chain from news sites and people on Twitter. In “<em>Why Apple’s iMessage Is Winning: Teens Dread the Green Text Bubble</em>”, the WSJ article paints Apple as using highly questionable tactics to keep its users locked in iMessage messaging service. I want to share my thoughts on this.</p>
<p>Peer pressure among teens isn’t a new phenomenon, far from it. Way before the Internet became accessible, when I was a teen myself, I vividly remember the feeling of not wearing the same brand of clothes as my friends. The problem here is teen&rsquo;s social behaviour, not the technology. They are the one to blame if they reject people using non iMessage messaging service. I would argue that Apple as nothing to do with this. Sure, they like the stickiness of their platform, but I wouldn’t say it&rsquo;s the defining goal when they add features to it.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple can’t provide the dot-dot-dot feedback showing people who are actually writing a response to a text message because the SMS standard doesn’t provide that. Duh.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hiroshi Lockheimer from Google refers to “standards” in <a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1479865157753147395?s=20">one of his tweets</a> to fix the interoperability issues of messaging platforms like iMessage, I wonder what standards he is referring to, Google’s <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/what-is-rcs-messaging/">RCS</a>. And if this standard is actually a standard, why is it so hard to take off? Why are messaging services like Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook Messenger, etc.?</p>
<p>I would also argue that, for a company like Apple, the ecosystem stickiness is part of their differentiating factor. Of course, iMessage plays a major role here. For a company like Google, where massively providing free services with ads, the more people who get to use your services, the more revenues you get. It’s their differentiating factor. It’s easy to say: Apple should open up their messaging service.</p>
<p>My anecdotal experience is to the effect that when something breaks in the conversation between an iPhone user and an Android users, they usually go with Messenger or WhatsApp. People still have access to many alternatives.</p>
<p>WSJ’s article is a prime example that finding the right angle to portray Apple as the devil in the room attracts numerous clicks.</p>

<p>I’ve been working in information technologies for nearly three decades. Finding competent people has always been a challenge. Keeping them too. But, in recent years, the situation has become simply critical, to the point where businesses are deeply impacted: delayed projects, abandoned initiatives, high pressures on other people, stress, etc. Businesses’ bottom line if at stake here.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/06/apple-engineering-director-m1-intel/">news</a> of the departure of one of the directors behind Apple’s transition from Intel to Apple’s own silicon, Mr. Jeff Wilcox, for its Mac product line is sad but probably just the tip of the iceberg. I wouldn’t read too much into this. I can imagine a team of many hundred engineers working on this program. People come, people go. Apple must cope with this. One could argue that when there are empty seats to fill, it becomes an opportunity for others to move in and try to be their best.</p>
<p>There are an infinite number of reasons why people leave a company. For Apple, the challenge is probably to stay attractive in a sea of opportunities for engineers. Apple cannot please everyone, all the time. I guess salaries is one of many other factors that come into play here. Apple is a legendary company where countless people would like to work there, me included. Pressure most be high in many key positions. Yet, the reward must be satisfying. I guess Mr. Wilcox has done what he thought could be done and succeeded. It’s often the good time to move on, and try something else while being at the top of their game.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of curves, but up until now, I didn’t really know how to take advantage of them. 🙃 Enter <a href="https://youtu.be/yFXyRI8mfBA">this short tutorial</a> for Pixelmator Pro. 😂 You’ll learn how to use the curves adjustment to tweak colours and luminance of any photos. I usually prefer to use sliders just because up until now I didn’t really get how to use the curves. Now, thanks to this tutorial, I have a much better idea. Many more tutorials are available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcza6SBHbklkfk3-2noKLvrF0UEk4B1oz">Pixelmator Pro YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The production quality of these tutorials is impeccable. I really love Pixelmator in general, and I always thought this photo processing application could have been done by Apple, when they cared enough about making one, back in the days. This isn’t a paid advertisement. I’m just being enthusiastic about great native macOS applications. 😌</p>

<p>Kuo has also said that the iPhone 14 Max, or whatever it ultimately ends up being called, will be priced at under $900. For comparison’s sake, the current iPhone lineup’s “Max” only includes the 6.7-inch iPhone 13 Pro Max, which is priced at $1,099.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly doubt that Apple will reduce the price of the top-of-the-line model of their iPhone line-up. Why would they do that? This would put pressure on lower-end models to go down in price too. Non sense.</p>

<p>Remember when people claimed <strong><em>Java</em></strong> would replace all computer languages? Maybe you remember when tech pundits told us that <strong><em>network computers</em></strong> would replace Windows PC? Or what about those who said that <strong><em>netbooks</em></strong> would replace laptops? Why some people consider the tech world to be a place where technologies always get replaced with another one? I tend to view the tech world as a space where several waves hitting the shores. Not everything disappears with each wave, and most of the time, technologies keep adding up.</p>
<p>What will replace the iPhone, you might ask? For me, nothing will replace the iPhone. But, according to Kelly Evans, the iPhone is going away. I don’t think her <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/kelly-evans-the-iphone-is-going-away.html">article</a> will age well. Is she really thinking that a vast majority of people will wear goggles and stop buying smartphones? Really? Is she serious, or am I missing something in her writing?</p>
<p>As much as I despise articles who pretend to predict a product failure on day one, I hate articles who predict success of an unannounced product like Apple’s AR headset.</p>
<p>I should create a Craft document where I store those articles with a date attached to them, like five years from now, and get back to them to see how well the prediction came to be.</p>

			 <p>Here is an update following yesterday’s <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2022/01/03/covid-got-me.html">post</a> about getting caught by COVID. I thought that I had been infected because of my symptoms. We all did a quick test after posting my article. The results came up <strong><em>positive</em></strong> for one of my friends, but everyone else was <strong><em>negative</em></strong>, including me. It could be false negatives, but I highly doubt it, except if we didn’t do the test correctly.</p>
<p>How am I feeling 24 hours later? I had a not-so-good night with a sour throat. It was like if I had a fever, my body felt heavy. That’s a strange feeling. We still have two quick tests on hand, which we’ll probably use before going back home today. We’ll probably go to a clinic to get a PCR test, but long lines of people are waiting to get tested, which is discouraging. I should probably just declare myself as positive.</p>
<p>The thing about COVID is that not everything is clear-cut, far from it. There is a lot of confusion, especially in this fifth wave with Omicron. We didn’t really know what to do with a single test coming out as positive. We spent the last week together, with the Omicron variant, It’s pretty sure we would become infected. My friends thought of leaving early but changed their minds because we all had very mild symptoms because we were all fully vaccinated. So we didn’t feel the need to panic or worry too much.</p>
<p>Our holiday vacation is ending on a sour note, to say the least. 😒</p>

<p>After close to two years of relentless fight to protect myself from COVID-19, after following all the government’s sanitary rules and telling others how it is important to get vaccinated, It appears that the virus won over me.</p>
<p>We had this “get together week” planned for a long time, with friends. We were six. Everyone limited their contacts to the minimum in the week before, in accordance to the rules in place at the time. Yet, the virus got in. One of my friend got infected probably following a quick visit to their family for a gift exchange. They stayed half an hour then left. It was enough, apparently to get infected. So they came to this vacation week with us, without knowing they would bring the virus with them. I’m not angry. I’m resigned.</p>
<p>I’m not feeling that bad as I write and publish this post. I have very few secretions, but I feel my lung irritated and I cough sometimes. No fever. No out-of-ordinary fatigue. My sleep is unaffected. It’s seems to be in line with people who got two vaccines. I’m hoping this will stay that way for the coming days.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll have to tell my kids that I got it in a social gathering that I asked them well too often not to do with their friends. That’s the hardest part. Guilt. 🤦🏻‍♂️</p>

<p>What if I documented all Apple computers I ever actively used or owned? For each of them, there is a story worth remembering and to write (<a href="https://numericcitizen-introspection.blog/friday-notes-47/">like this one from 1986</a>), the general context of its use, what software did I use on it at the time, how I bought it, how long did I own it and which new computer replaced it? There is even a ten-years pause where I left the Apple bandwagon to switch to the other side. What happened? Why?</p>
<p>Using the excellent and must-have utility, <a href="https://mactracker.ca">MacTracker</a>, which I should have included in my post “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/12/22/the-perfect-apple-enthusiast-find-out-where-you-stand/" title="The Perfect Apple Enthusiast — Find Out Where You Stand">The Perfect Apple Enthusiast — Find Out Where You Stand</a>”, I started to process of going back in times.

<p>Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/photography-needs-to-be-fun/">blog post</a> about his interest for Glass’s fading out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was very high on Glass, a new photo sharing app this summer, but my enthusiasm for it has dropped in perfect sync with the temperature dropping here in the Midwest since then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lee Peterson <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/12/20/glass-is-becoming-a-boring-place-for-photography/">blog post</a> about his interest is so low that he canceled his Glass subscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still feel it was a bad slope to start down by adding appreciation and I’ve cancelled my subscription.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Andy Nicolaides <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyNicolaides/status/1472634298775883785?s=20">on Twitter</a> thinking out loud about the introduction of “appreciation” (a term used instead of “likes”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not one of the folks that wasn’t a big fit of Glass adding the likes / appreciation function, but I’ll tell you this much, in my small case study of one, it’s completely killed off any comments I used to receive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s be honest: <em>Glass has been alive for less than four months</em>. They kept updating the service since the beginning to improve the experience and discoverability. They didn’t fall in the “me too” trap yet. Aren’t we expecting too much too soon from such a small organization? Should we expect them to come out with the right recipe on day one? Could this be much more difficult to be different and yet familiar in the crowded space of on-line photo sharing? I would argue that your feed is as good as the people you follow. Sure, Glass needs to attract great photographers. I suspect they are working on it as I write this. People are busy. Living in a pandemic put a lot of stress on everybody and cancelled so many opportunities for doing photography, but it created others too. It wasn’t the best moment to launch such a service, and yet, they’ve done a great job so far.</p>
<p>I do have a subscription to Glass (my profile page <a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">here</a>) and I’m willing to be patient here. I have a goal of posting at least one picture a week, even though I have another place to do so, on Smugmug (my profile page <a href="https://numericcitizen.smugmug.com">here</a>).</p>

			 <p>Surprising to see <strong>Snapseed</strong> being updated since it is owned by Google. I use this photo processing application to create the posts in the Perfect Imperfection Series on my Smugmug account. If Google was to kill this app, it would probably put an end to my photo series. I tried to find other apps to replace Snapseed but failed to find something that comes close. Now, why is Google even bother maintaining Snapseed? How does it fit their business model?</p>

<p>I want to chime in on a series of posts by Matt Birchler (<a href="https://youtu.be/brOOMZsvJ-Q">on his YouTube channel</a>) and Andy Nicolaides (<a href="https://thedent.net/is-the-ipad-exciting/">on his The Dent website</a>) regarding the iPad. The question is clear: is the iPad still exciting?</p>
<p>It all depends on the use case. I came to realize in 2021 that the iPad (even in its Pro incarnation) cannot be as powerful and effective in my workflow as the MacBook Air. Besides creating content, is the iPad Pro still relevant? You bet! There is nothing beating the feeling of tearing the iPad from its Magic Keyboard and sitting on the couch for reading or browsing the web. Every single time, I enjoy the experience in all its glory, if such a thing can be said. The other use case that I came to appreciate is Sidecar. The iPad Pro, even in its 11” size, proves to be a superb and useful second screen to my Mac mini. And using the iPad with its Magic Keyboard, when I’m on the go, is still a superb experience, as long as I set my expectations accordingly.</p>
<p>With iPadOS 15, Apple did address a few more low-hanging fruits from a software perspective. There is still a lot to accomplish, but more than ever I feel Apple is giving the iPad the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>In summary, the iPad can be super exciting, it all comes down to its use case. For me, it still is, when I use it.</p>

<p>I remember working on “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/05/16/a-guide-for-preparing-to-leave-your-numeric-legacy/" title="A Guide for Preparing to Leave Your Numeric Legacy">A Guide for Preparing to Leave Your Numeric Legacy</a>”, one of the cited challenges was to get access to the deceased person’s online data. I provided ways and a methodology to get ready for their numeric legacy. With iOS 15’s <strong>Legacy Contacts</strong>, Apple is making it much easier. The setup process takes less than 2 minutes to complete. An access key and a death certificate are required to ask Apple to let the legacy contacts to gain access to the online data. At long last, big tech companies now consider important to let people surviving people to keep access to deceased people in a simple and secure way. I can see countless headaches being prevented with this feature, first promised at WWDC last June. Bravo to Apple.</p>

<p>The previous screenshots show the release notes, as seen on an iPhone. I just can’t believe Apple cannot fix the font size. It’s been like this life forever. It’s all in the details, Apple, in the details. Gosh.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing for me is the <strong>App Privacy Report</strong>, which I love. As an IT guy in my professional life, I like to see what’s going on in my devices. App Privacy Report is a great way to show this to me.</p>

<p>Notifications Summary has a refined design. The summary goes edge-to-edge with the screen. It’s a bit weird. I don’t know if this is a bug or a feature. Yet, I like to see more information in the summary as each notification offers expanded content.</p>
<p>As a side note, apparently, Apple won’t release Universal Control this year. I couldn’t care less because I don’t see this as useful in my current workflow. Maybe there is something to Universal Control that I don’t get.</p>

<p>If you’ve been reading my blogs for a while, you probably know by now that I’m a big fan of <strong>Unsplash</strong> (“<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2019/04/10/my-growing-love-affair-with-unsplash/" title="My Growing Love Affair with Unsplash">My Growing Love Affair with Unsplash</a>”). I’ve been using Unsplash constantly to find and use pictures in many of my posts (when I cannot find one of mines that fit the post subject). My contributions slowed a bit in the last year because I spend more time building my online presence on Smugmug (<a href="https://numericcitizen.smugmug.com">my Smugmug page</a>) and more recently on Glass (<a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">my profile on Glass</a>).</p>
<p>This week, the picture above has been selected to be featured in the architecture category. I’m honoured. You can see <a href="https://unsplash.com/t/architecture">my featured photo in the architecture category</a> right now. The last time that I’ve been <em>unsplashed</em> was less than a year ago, I wrote about it on my main blog: <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/30/ive-been-unsplashed/" title="OMG — I’ve Been Unsplashed!">OMG — I’ve Been Unsplashed!</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So, <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/12/05/about-microblog-upcoming.html">as expected</a>, yesterday <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/12/06/introducing-email-newsletter.html">Micro.blog introduced support for newsletters</a> in the premium subscription tier. The official announcement follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we’re announcing a major new feature for Micro.blog Premium subscribers: email newsletters. Micro.blog can now manage, letting readers subscribe to your blog and receive emails for new blog posts. It’s deeply integrated into Micro.blog and works great for collecting multiple microblog posts together automatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is why I upgraded my subscription plan almost instantly after the news came out.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/4b9777e139.png" alt=""></p>
<p>First, I’m a big fan of Micro.blog as a publishing platform and also of its foundational principles. I’m totally ok with paying a monthly fee of $10 to support the team behind—I want the platform to thrive. Second, adding support for newsletters is a great idea. Not everyone is using an RSS feed reader or like to read content through a browser. Everyone uses email clients! It’s important to provide different ways of communicating content to the readers. Newsletters are making a comeback.</p>
<p>Enabling newsletter is dead simple as shown below. I chose the weekly newsletter containing all the posts for the past week. Email go out at 9AM, local time, each Saturday morning. It’s a good way to start the weekend, isn’t it?</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/1e79d6e31e.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, the settings are quite simple. There is no formatting option (yet). Having a choice between all text vs excerpt would be a useful one. Speaking of formatting, one thing that I&rsquo;m curious about, though: how does one newsletter look like? I couldn&rsquo;t find an example in the documentation. Furthermore, how can we preview the next newsletter issue? It seems that, in case the first option is selected (one email for each post), the author has 30 minutes after posting to preview the email as explained here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/timapple">@timapple</a> The preview works the same for the weekly and monthly option except it only creates it 30 minutes before it&rsquo;s ready to send. Micro.blog will send you a preview email automatically with a link to edit it then. — Manton Reece <a href="https://micro.blog/manton/12238527">https://micro.blog/manton/12238527</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does Micro.blog newsletter feature fit in my workflow? Micro.blog newsletter joins two other services that I depend on: Mailbrew to create something very similar in nature to Micro.blog offering and Ghost for my monthly newsletter (<a href="https://numericcitizen-introspection.blog/a-new-home-for-the-numeric-citizen-introspection-newsletter/">previously on Substack</a>). On Mailbrew though, <a href="https://app.mailbrew.com/apple_observer/numeric-citizen-reading-writing-summary-newsletter-x9MmQUXjnEMG?aff=apple_observer">my summary newsletter</a> also brings in content published on other platforms (WordPress, Blot, Ghost, Smugmug, etc.). It’s the ultimate weekly posts summary newsletter. Ghost, for <a href="https://numericcitizen-introspection.blog">my introspection newsletter</a>, is like Substack, but better. I see Micro.blog offering as being a convenient way for my readers to get my content into their mailbox. It won’t replace Mailbrew or Ghost, obviously.</p>
<p>By subscribing to the premium tier, I also get a few goodies that could prove to be useful: bookmarking archiving and highlighting. The former allows for the bookmarking of a post on my timeline. The latter allows me to highlight some text while reading a bookmarked post or URL. Highlighted text can be conveniently used to create a link post easily. One thing that I would love to see is a browser extension for selecting text in any website. I’m not holding my breath, though.</p>
<p>All in all, I’m pretty happy with this addition to an already great service for content creators like me. Oh, and don’t forget to <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/subscribe/">subscribe</a> to the weekly digest! So, to those who subscribe, I guess this post is the first to get through the newsletter feature of Micro.blog!</p>

<p>Apparently, it looks like <a href="https://www.manton.org/2021/12/04/putting-the-final.html">tomorrow</a>, <strong>Micro.blog is going to add support for newsletters</strong>. A few weeks ago, I can’t remember exactly, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">Manton</a> posted a screenshot (which I can no longer find) where a “newsletter” item was shown on the left sidebar on the Micro.blog main site.</p>
<p>I’m very curious about Micro.blog take on newsletter. Micro.blog is all about simplicity without being too simplistic. If the feature is available to entry-level paid tier, I’m might enable it and use it myself. Right now, I’m using <strong>Mailbrew</strong> to gather all my published posts via the RSS feed to generate <a href="https://app.mailbrew.com/apple_observer/numeric-citizen-reading-writing-summary-newsletter-x9MmQUXjnEMG">a newsletter</a>. There is one thing though, are we starting to feel a bit of newsletters fatigue?</p>
<p>Can’t wait for tomorrow.</p>

<p>The photo thumbnails are from a personal trip to Austria in 1998. When I look back at these photos, I have to come to a conclusion that my photographic style didn’t really change in 30 years. It feels a bit depressing. It is basically revolving about architecture, nature. Very rarely about people, these are too hard to capture; I don’t have a good sense of timing, and I’m shy. I’m rarely doing street photography. The only addition to my subjects in recent years is urban exploration. Do we come into this world with a pre-determined photographic style?</p>

<p>Boooooo… Well, it looks like I changed my mind. I didn’t remember that I wrote <a href="https://numericcitizen.io/2021/03/17/ghost-4-is-out-so-what">this blog post following the release of Ghost 4.0</a>. At the time, I didn’t see the benefit, but now, it’s quite another story. I really love Ghost and I think I made the right choice for a few significant reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ghost comes with APIs, which enable all sort of possibilities to improve my workflow.</li>
<li>Ghost editor is much more powerful than Substack’s. This week, they started to release new cards type: GIF and Button. They promise another ten before Christmas! Yeah!</li>
<li>I prefer Ghost’s design in general over Substack.</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently testing Synology as a storage solution for all my non-personal, non-photographic digital assets that I often use to complement my blog posts. After testing Synology Moments, their previous solution for photo management on DSM 6.2, Synology Photos in DSM 7.x is a step in the right direction, a big improvement. I like what I&rsquo;m seeing. It&rsquo;s fast. The ability to use folders as well as albums to organize my collection is a big plus. I&rsquo;ve yet to find a bug. There is an iPad version of their Synology Photos. It&rsquo;s not perfect but it works. Lacking is support iPad multitasking, which is a shame but not a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>In order to test this solution, I&rsquo;m using my DS720+ running DSM7 beta inside a virtual machine. DSM Virtual Machine Manager allows the execution of a Virtual DSM which is very cool for testing future releases of their software. I&rsquo;m impressed by the relative speed of this setup running on 6 GB of RAM, 2 x 6 TB SATA drives and a Samsung M2 NVMe 512 GB cache drive.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Readdle software released an update to <strong>PDF Expert</strong> with support for Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2021/11/shareplay-powers-new-ways-to-stay-connected-and-share-experiences-in-facetime/">SharePlay</a>. Using FaceTime, up to 32 people can share and annotate a PDF. According to the <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/pdf-expert-shareplay/">documented workflow</a> on The MacObserver website, while in a FaceTime call, opening a PDF file with PDF Expert enables the SharePlay feature.</p>
<p>I tried the SharePlay experience using Music and screen sharing to see how easy the SharePlay workflow is to master. Each of my test with Apple Music ended up with a popup saying the selected content couldn’t be shared (probably controlled by the owner of the music track-not surprising at all). With screen sharing, I had more success and the feature worked as expected.</p>
<p>I think this is all cool and SharePlay brings Apple’s ecosystem closer to what is possible within Zoom or Teams.</p>
<p>What I’d like to see is more application support for SharePlay. Apple’s Keynote would be another winner where people could watch the same presentation together. I find it surprising that’s not already the case. Maybe an upcoming update to iWork will fix that.</p>
<p>l’ll definitively play with this more in the coming days because I think SharePlay has a lot o potential, especially in the business space.</p>

<p>On my iPad Pro, in split-screen view: on the left, Lightroom. On the right, Apple’s Photos. Same photo in DNG format (ProRAW) edited with available features and possibilities of each application. Lightroom wins, obviously. Recent update to Lightroom adds editing masks which makes a big difference in achieving desired results. Picture taken with iPhone 13 Pro. On the beach. While in vacation. Cheers. 😎🍹</p>

			 <p>When I got my first AirTags, I was anxious to get this wallet from this KickStarter project: “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickaugeri/snapback-slim-air-a-wallet-for-airtags" title="Snapback Slim Air - A Wallet for AirTags">Snapback Slim Air - A Wallet for AirTags</a>”. This is my Snapback Slim Air. With the AirTag inserted.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/88b4837330.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Can you see the problem? The AirTag hardly stays in place and has the tendency to pop out of its place. Not great at all. I always found the fitting to be so so. Then, today I got an email from KickStarter with the following promotional photo. Can you see what I’m doing wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/e4fda6e56d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I happen to insert my AirTag the wrong side. Duh! The white side (the best looking one IMHO) must be inside and the silver side exposed outside. Ooops. Here’s the result.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/1504293741.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, the fitting is a bit better but not that much better. I’m already looking for alternatives. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/">YouTube will remove the dislike button</a> soon from its platform. In one of his <a href="https://youtu.be/CaaJyRvvaq8">recent video</a>, the popular YouTuber, Marques Brownlee, expresses his dissatisfaction about Google’s decision. His view echos mine. I’m not a big consumer of YouTube content, but when I do spend time there, I want to spend it on good quality content. The like / dislike ratio is an important indicator for me, and I suspect it is for many people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We heard during the experiment that some of you have used the public dislike count to help decide whether or not to watch a video. We know that you might not agree with this decision, but we believe that this is the right thing to do for the platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the content creators should play a bigger role in all this: let them decide. The same way a blogger can turn off the comment section at the end of each blog post, people’s reactions on each video could be turned off by the author’s decision. In fact, I would argue that the ultimate decision to allow likes and dislikes should be held by the content creators. Simple as that. Make it an opt-in or opt-out default, but put the decision in creator’s hands. I would go as far as saying that the counters could stay private to the author if he or she decides so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To me, one of the best rewarding indicator is the one that shows how far users are watching videos. They may agree or disagree, but as soon as they watch most of it, anything else is irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if this decision by YouTube better serves their interests. I mean, without any ratio indicator, users have no choice but to start to play the video to decide if it is worth the time. This simple change makes people spend more time on the platform. Or is it the other way around and users will instead look at the comments to get a better idea of the video quality? I doubt it, as reading takes too much time to decide. People are busy, their attention span is short, a quick glance at the like dislike ratio is the way to go.</p>
<p>Once the decision to let people react to a video is made, then the platform could finally make it available only if the user watch “most of” the video. That no rocket science. There are probably other tricks that could be played to better control what’s going on in user’s reactions. But at this stage, it seems closer to be only implementation details.</p>
<p>As for the creator’s mental health issue, again, I would argue that if they tend to rely too much on the likes to feel rewarded, they could turn off the option. That’s something that could help <a href="https://gregmorris.co.uk/blog/do-i-like-likes/">others</a> in dealing with this.</p>
<p>Glass, a photo sharing service, didn’t provide a like button from day one and doesn’t plan to add one. Is it good? Well, it depends. One thing is clear, from the comments I’m seeing posted by others, I have to ask myself: what is the difference between getting dozens of “I love it” or hitting the “like” button? Not much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think that people have that choice today, Andrew, if you want to sideload, you can buy an Android phone.”</p>

<p>Tim Cook’s answer reminds me of another one. Steve Jobs once said that if you want porn on a phone, just buy an Android phone. Apple’s stance is fascinating. You want shit? There’s Android for that.</p>

<p>Even though I’m using Ulysses for most of my writings, after reading the “<a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/josh-ginters-ulysses-setup-and-workflow/">A Complete Ulysses Writing Workflow</a>”, it gave me the idea of revisiting the way I organize my content in Craft. As shown in the previous screenshot, my content is now organized following a similar flow often seen on Kansan boards. As you might expect, everything start in the Inbox folder then eventually get “promoted” to the next folder, according to the content’s maturity. I like this a lot—it’s much cleaner than before. I should have known better, as I experienced the Kanban method a few years ago at work.</p>

<p>Here is a situation for which I’m searching for a solution. Let’s say I’m going out with my iPhone 13 Pro to take a few pictures outside. After a while, I notice that all the pictures that I was shooting were in ProRAW format. What if the lighting conditions were great that day and my photos didn’t require post-processing of any kind besides the iPhone’s own processing? How can I convert from ProRAW to their optimized JPEG counterparts and keep them in my iCloud Photo Library? Such process would decrease image size by a factor of ten.</p>
<p>I cannot find an answer for this seemingly easy question. So far, it all comes down to exporting the photos from Apple’s Photos application and then reimporting them. Such process needs to be followed by the deletion of all the original photos to prevent duplicates. There has to be a better way. Shortcuts, on iOS or macOS doesn’t provide any solutions as far as I can tell. Why is such thing not possible? If you happen to have a solution for this, please let me know.</p>

<p>The other day I was looking at my iPhone battery consumption only to find out that the Exposure notifications feature was consuming close to 10% of the power on a 24 hours period. It’s not the first that I see Exposure Notifications to take so much juice out of my iPhone battery. I’m not alone, apparently, according to a Google search with the “exposure notifications battery drain” keywords.</p>
<p>The question is simple: considering that I’m fully vaccinated, considering the state of the pandemic here in Canada, considering that hardly any people actually enter their test results if found positive, why should I continue to care about having this turned on? <a href="https://jimmytechsf.com/vaccinated-turn-off-exposure-notification-for-an-iphone-battery-boost/">I think I could turn it off</a>.</p>

<p>This seemingly insignificant box used to be sold by Apple and contained ten single-sided floppy disks. Those were meant to be used in a Macintosh computer. I had a bunch of them but somehow managed to keep an empty box. It was a great time.</p>
<p>Each floppy contained a whopping 400 KB of storage for a single-sided version. At one point we could get them for 70$ a piece. It was expansive compared to 5 1/4 inches flexible floppy disks that contained either 160 KB or 360 KB that were typically used in IBM PCs. From a design perspective, Apple’s floppy disks were rigid, smaller, sturdier and dust proof, hence a higher asking price.</p>

<p>I’m still learning new things about shooting in <strong>ProRAW</strong> on my iPhone 13 Pro. The latest tidbits that I learned is not directly related to ProRAW usage, but to a setting in Halide related to photo capture modes.</p>
<p>When using what is called “<strong>Pro+</strong>” setting, Halide will take two photos for each shot. One is taken in HEIC format, the other is taken in ProRAW. Both photos are tied together and stored in Apple’s Photos library as one image. Here is the thing that I learned: when browsing previously taken photos from within Halide, metadata is shown in two different panels: HEIC and DNG (see above screenshots). Each component is taking a certain amount of space. The former being the smallest one. The latter, being the ProRAW version, is usually ten times bigger. But, when browsing the same photo in Photos, only the HEIC size is shown, as depicted in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/6a3c90e785.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In summary, for pictures taken with Halide’s Pro+ format, don’t be deceived by Apple’s Photos showing only the HEIC size. The actual space consumed by this image is actually the sum of the HEIC part + ProRAW part (in DNG). That’s big, for only one image. Is it worth it? It depends, as <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/10/23/is-the-cost.html">I recently wrote about this</a>.</p>

			 <p>I’m still trying to wrap my mind around Apple’s ProRAW. I know, I’m late to the party. Image size can be as much as 10x the size of a jpeg. I think that for non-edge cases (optimal lighting), ProRAW “cost” isn’t worth it. Also, ProRAW images taken with Halide are much smaller than using Apple’s camera app, for reasons I still don’t understand.</p>

<p>Timery received a major addition in this week’s update: REPORTS! As I wrote recently, <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/09/19/why-and-how-im-tracking-time-with-toggl/">I’m tracking the time I spend on my blogging and content creation activities</a>. Timery is my go-to client for Toggl, a time tracking service. Having access to reports within the application, instead of heading to the Toogl’s website is really helpful. Now, looking forward for Timery to support macOS Monterey’s Shortcuts!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2021/10/19/a-few-unleashed.html">A Few #Unleashed Observations About That #AppleEvent</a></h1>

<p>The less than an hour Unleashed event took place yesterday, I was there… watching on my Mac mini. I had these observations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://youtu.be/OxJpZtp2ItE">opening sequence</a> with the man in its garage building a song based on sound from Apple devices, like the Mac startup sound was different, some sort of Mac celebration. Is this garage setup intentional and a reference to Apple’s beginnings? Probably.</li>
<li>Today, I would argue that Apple completed 80% of its transition to its Apple Silicon. The Mac Pro will probably be the last to get the Apple Silicon treatment. What a monster it will be. We’ll probably get a bigger iMac and beeper Mac mini meanwhile. 2022.</li>
<li>There is not much not to like in Apple’s MacBook Pro announcement. These MacBook Pro are technical marvels. Lots of “speeds and feeds” for sure but hey, that was for the pros, right?</li>
<li>The M1 Pro / M1 Max branding makes me think of <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors.html">Intel’s</a>.</li>
<li>The notch… comes with a bonus, more screen estate. Is there room to complain? I wonder how good apps with many menus will look like. Yet, with all the hardware prowess Apple is capable of, I still wonder why they cannot put the FaceTime camera in the bezel, even that thin. Center Stage? Nope. Requires a better camera for that.</li>
<li>I’m not looking to buy a new MacBook or any Apple devices for that matter. I’m super happy with my M1 Mac mini and M1 MacBook Air. But, a friend of mine ordered the 14”. Can’t wait to have his comments.</li>
<li>This design changes are more or less subtile and it is quite interesting to note that it is <a href="https://twitter.com/zhenpixels/status/1450162245351006210?s=20">reminiscent of the PowerBook G4 Titanium</a>. I love it.</li>
<li>The keyboard, without the Touch Bar, with its black background, looks so… pro. I love it. The best combination to me is with the silver version of the MacBook Pro, the contrast is even higher, more pro.</li>
<li>Now, am I alone to think that the iMac / Mac mini could be the next to receive the M1 Pro and M1 Max treatment?</li>
<li>The ProMotion display, which is based on the Liquid Retina Display, looks impressive. We’ll see what the reviewers have to say next week.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another solid virtual event for Apple. Oh, Voice plan for Music? That was weird. I don’t get it. I thought Siri was bad as an interface to search for music. Apple must have a different take with that one. Now, the big question, is there any new stuff left for Apple this year? I think so. And that’s ok.</p>

<p>We went to the movies yesterday night. The first time in two years. “No Time To Die” was good. As much as other types of business has evolved in this time frame, buying tickets, bad quality lighting, flaky sound systems are still part of my usual subpar experience at the movies. No wonder why this is a dying business.</p>

<p>Matt Bircher on the lack of “Like” on Glass:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is a terrible idea and I&rsquo;m in the minority here, but I really do think that I would enjoy the app more if I was able to give lower-friction reactions to people&rsquo;s photos. I still like Glass quite a bit, and I browse it everyday, but I do often feel like I don&rsquo;t have the energy to comment on all the photos I like, and that&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lee Peterson’s take on his blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not having follower counts and likes is a great way to stop the comparison to others and help to reduce the stress of feeling bad about myself for not making engaging content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not an easy thing to consider. Matt’s point of view also echos mine. If Glass added likes, does that put them on the path of Instagram, ads, and algorithm-based feed? I don’t think so. Glass is a paid service. That’s the key.</p>
<p>What if the decision of enabling likes was delegated to the photographer posting photos? I would enable it, Matt probably would too, but not Lee. The same goes for seeing and showing the followers count on the profile page. What if those decisions were put in the hands of the content creator? Let the platform have it builtin and the content creator decide what to do with it. Twitter’s Revue offers such a feature of showing the subscribers count on the Revue profile page. I like it, and <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/apple_observer">it is enabled</a>, even though I only have two subscribers.</p>
<p>On Micro.blog, the situation is pretty much the same. We don’t get likes to our posts, we don’t get to see how many followers we’ve got. I made requests to the guy behind Micro.blog for the ability to see the followers count on Micro.blog without much success. This data could be made private, and we could enable to show it on our profile page.</p>
<p>Why is the platform the only one making those decisions? Let the content creators decide. You can find me on Glass under the Numericcitizen moniker, here is <a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen/177p1t0W8JcEpFmwWuORyw">one of my shared photo</a>.</p>

			 <p>Google, recently on Twitter, announcing their adoption of Apple’s UIKit design language instead of using their Material design:</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/f860b2806b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Does a switch really need to be built custom in alignment with a generic design system? Or might it be sufficient to simply use the system solution and move on?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t buy Google’s explanation. Google is trying to say that UIKit wasn’t good enough for them, so they went their own way. Bullshit. The other way to look at this: building native apps is a better way to go than trying to build apps on unifying frameworks.</p>

<p>Today, Vanmoof announced their latest e-bike, the Vanmoof V model. The announcement video, reminiscent of Apple’s product reveals, is light on details. The singular design, in white, is both intriguing and looks heavy on the look. Some specs are impressive, on paper. But, there is something absolutely troubling: the V model is going to ship near the end of 2022. Yep, in more than a year. What is going on here? What this premature announcement could mean for Vanmoof? Well, obviously they are trying to gain mind share among potential e-bike buyers, and they are afraid to lose market share.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ll be developing the VanMoof V over the upcoming year, and will keep you updated with news and features as the bike comes to life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine if Apple were to announce a new flagship product iteration, the next iPhone, more than a year in advance? I wonder if Vanmoof is aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect">Osborne effect</a>. 🧐</p>

			 <p>Been thinking about Notion recently. Before using Craft, I was a fan of Notion. I spent a few moments today on Notion to make some cleanup. I think I’m still a fan. Craft feels better for me as a writer tool. Yet, Notion is features rich. They keep improving it. I don’t know  if they do it at a faster pace than Craft. They are certainly more mature. The team behind Craft being smaller, they don’t have the same resources. Many features are missing. But there is something to it that is missing in Notion. Craft being native on the Mac (it’s a Catalyst app), it makes a big difference. Anyway, I’ll keep an eye on Notion. Who knows if I’ll come back.</p>

<p>After many weeks of trying, I finally sold my 2017 21.5 inches iMac. Even though Apple is currently selling M1 iMac at a competitive price, I thought that it would be easier to get rid of my Mac. It was a maxed out configuration, which helped me ask for a higher than usual price compared to other sellers. Yet, it wasn’t easy. As you might guess, I’m not the only one trying to sell an Intel-based iMac.</p>
<p>The next device put on sale was my iPhone 11 Pro with 256 GB of storage. One week before the officiel launch of the iPhone 13 Pro, I put up my older iPhone for sale. I got quite a few people interested in it, but the problem was the price they were willing to offer. It was way under my asking price, closer to what Apple is offering as a trade-in value. I think this is part of the problem. Many people are looking to get rid of their older devices to help pay for the new one, but potential buyers are comparing to what Apple is offering, which shouldn’t be used to fix the value of the second hand iPhone. Apple will refurbish the device or recycle it. This cannot be used as a comparison. After a week of getting my trade-in kit, I decided to return my iPhone instead of bothering to sell it.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/09/01/coming-out-of-a-rabbit-hole-and-buying-two-macbook-air/">I bought my MacBook Air</a> back in August, it came with a free pair of AirPods. I didn’t need them, so I put them on sale too. That one was easy to sell, though. It took less than half a day to find someone willing to get them.</p>
<p>It’s true that Apple hardware keep their resale value, but I think it’s not what it used to be. Apple is no longer the underdog, their devices are everywhere, which puts pressure on pricing.</p>
<p>What’s I’d like to see come in Canada is the iPhone upgrade program available in the US. I think I would pay a monthly price to always get the newer iPhone.</p>

<p>This podcast <a href="https://appstories.net/posts/the-ipad-mini-small-wonder">episode</a> from MacStories featuring <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Viticci</a> triggered quite a few reactions. Why? Because of these two sentences in the first moments of the episode talking about the iPad mini:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You wouldn’t want to read/or watch a review by someone who is not a professional reviewer. It wouldn’t be enjoyable.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. Viticci said that. In “<a href="https://merecivilian.com/the-value-of-a-non-reviewers-perspective/">The value of a non-reviewer’s perspective</a>” from <a href="https://twitter.com/MereCivilian">Mere Civilian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”I agree, a review from a person who does not write for a living may not be enjoyable. However, I strongly disagree with the first sentence. “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? Really? Then, I read <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/09/29/im-not-a-professional-but-my-opinion-is-valid-too/">this reaction</a> from Lee Peterson on his blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”MacStories posts some great stuff but not everyone wants to read long articles, some like smaller easy to digest articles from independent writers, I like to think I do that here. I get to the point and try to respect my audiences time, does that make my opinion invalid or not enjoyable?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is my response. Viticci comments make him look full of himself. Period. I’m happy for him if he can live from writing reviews. I would rather read review from real end-users because the point is to get comments and observations from real use case scenarios. Sure, I like reviews from Marques Brownlee because he has well-balanced and critical point of views on a lot of stuff. It also touches the subject of what makes someone a blogger or a writer. If you write constantly, then you are a writer. Are you Shakespeare? Probably not. There is a starting point for everyone. Some will fall along the road, others will thrive. I tend to think of reviews by professionnel reviewers as synthetic reviews, where there is a lot of speed and feed talk. At some point, we want to go beyond that and have comments coming from experience. So, sure, I’d like to read comments from pilots about the real usefulness of the iPad mini. They are the one who can make a judgment on the subject.</p>
<p>Last year I wrote “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/03/im-not-an-audiophile-but-here-are-my-thoughts-on-apples-airpods-max/" title="I’m not an audiophile, but here are my thoughts on Apple’s AirPods Max">I’m not an audiophile, but here are my thoughts on Apple’s AirPods Max</a>” which is not of “review” but a collection of observations. I concluded with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>”So, do I like the sound quality of my AirPods Max? Yes. Do they sound better than my Bose QC25? Yes. By a wide margin compared with the price difference with my Bose Q25? No. But, hey, they are wireless, convenient, comfier, have transparency mode, spatial audio and they fit within Apple’s walled garden.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there any value in this? I think so. Should Viticci care? Certainly not. I do have genuine thoughts and opinions, and this is my ultimate right to share them with the world for exactly what they are: <em>thoughts and observations</em>. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>Today Apple is publishing <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-maps-introduces-new-ways-to-explore-major-cities-in-3d/">an article</a> on its newsroom website about all the new thing that comes with Maps in iOS 15. There is a lot to like in this update, like the 3D detailed views in some major cities like San Francisco. These 3D views remind me of SimCity, a game on which I’ve spent countless hours playing. Maps as matured over the years, following the <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/09/16/the-iterative-apple.html">iterative nature of Apple’s approach</a> to everything they do. Some don’t like it, others see the value in it. I’m one of those who think this is the best approach as each iteration helps build the next one with good cumulative experience. Today’s Maps, nine year later after a rocky start, in 2012, is impressive and as good as other popular alternatives, in my area at least.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s announcements this week are nothing less than impressive. Microsoft is showing courage. Their Surface are striking. These things will probably be hot as hell (pun intended, thanks to Intel Inside). I’m hoping users will have a better experience than many of my colleague who had their Surface replaced in the last year because of over heating issues. Stylus On the surface (pun intended) may not work as well as the Apple Pencil on the iPad. Apple is at their best in that regard. Yet, we have to give them credits for what they are doing. They are iterating with more than incremental updates. They try new things. It’s interesting to see Microsoft aligning itself with Apple strategy: vertical integration (hardware + software: Windows) with a yearly release schedule. Designed for Windows 11. Well done.</p>
<p>Now, looking forward to Apple’s next announcement: the MacBook Pro “redesign”. Don’t expect anything close to what Microsoft is doing. But expect Apple to reintroduce the HDMI port and the SD Card reader. According the latest <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/09/22/tim-would-love.html">leaks</a>.</p>

<p>Compared to last’s year iOS 14, early numbers show a much slower adoption rate for iOS 15. The problem? Last year was about the iPhone experience getting widgets. That’s a very material change. This year? Even if widgets now come to the iPad, it is far less reaching than it was on the iPhone. Things like focus modes are not as flashy as widgets but are damn useful, <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/09/21/how-is-ipados-15-helping-me-as-a-blogger-and-content-creator/">to me at least</a>.</p>

<p>After a long summer of beta releases, today we get to see the final releases of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Are you feeling as excited as a few years ago at the same time? Personally, even if I think those are great iterative updates, I don’t. There is less to grab by developers it seems. I’m not expecting exciting new releases for any of my apps. What about yours?</p>

<p>If you think that this year&rsquo;s updates from Apple are <strong><em>meh</em></strong>, I think, either you didn’t pay attention during the keynote or you’re simply bored. You may not like the iterative nature of Apple under Tim Cook, maybe you forgot to remember that the smartphone (and to some degree) the smartwatch are mature products. Since Apple is paying attention to what the majority of people actually care about, improving battery life, adding more storage, keeping prices steady, not having to wait three months to get a new device, stop expecting folding iPhone to prove Apple is still innovating.</p>
<p>There, I said it.</p>

<p>One of <a href="https://marco.org/2021/09/13/future-of-the-app-store">the best recent take</a> on the possible future of the App Store.</p>
<p>Regarding IAP purchases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most apps will be required to also offer IAP side-by-side with any external methods</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Many games will offer both IAP and external purchases, with the external choice offering a discount, bonus gems, extra loot boxes, or other manipulative tricks to optimize the profitability of casino games for children</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>External purchase methods will evolve to be almost as convenient as IAP</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The payment-fraud doomsday scenarios argued by Apple and many fans mostly won’t happen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, App Store side-loading and alternative App Stores:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook would soon have apps that bypassed App Review installed on the majority of iPhones in the world.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Without the threat of App Review to keep them in check, Facebook’s apps would become even more monstrous than they already are.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Alternative app stores would be even worse. Rather than offering individual apps via side-loading, Facebook could offer just one: The Facebook App Store.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Maybe Google would bring the Play Store to iOS and offer a unified SDK to develop a single codebase for iOS and Android, effectively making every app feel like an Android app</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Media conglomerates that own many big-name properties, like Disney, might each have their own app stores for their high-profile apps.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Most developers would probably need to start submitting our apps to multiple app stores, each with its own rules, metadata, technical requirements, capabilities, approval delays, payment processing, stats, crash reports, ads, promotion methods, and user reviews.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a few words: what a fucking mess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t expect side-loading or alternative app stores to become possible, and I’m relieved, because that is not a future I want for iOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not so sure this won’t happen, but I’m sure that’s something I don’t want too. If only Apple could better read the room’s temperature and budge a tad.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.readwise.io/readwise-reading-app/">recent announcement</a> by Readwise.io:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re now in position to reimagine aspects of the digital reading experience itself, from how you annotate a document, to how you navigate. Readwise as you know it today isn&rsquo;t going anywhere, but this is our future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the new Readwise reading app, not only will these resurfacing and syncing features not go away, they will be enhanced through tight integration into the reading experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is much more to digest on their published essay. They’ve been thinking about this for a while and judging from a few screenshots, their reading app seems compelling and well done. I’m hoping they will support Safari’s extensions. RSS feeds will be supported too. Sadly, it will probably be another Electron-based app. We’ll see if this doesn’t affect too much the experience.</p>
<p>I’ve been a subscriber of Readwise.io for a while, but I must admit that I’m not taking advantage of it as much as I would have liked. It does get synced with my Pocket account, but that’s about it. Oh, and my saved quotes get resurfaced in my <a href="https://app.mailbrew.com/apple_observer/numeric-citizen-newsletter-x9MmQUXjnEMG">Mailbrew summary newsletter</a>, which is cool.</p>
<p>I’ve subscribed to their private beta testers waiting list and I can’t wait to try it out. If all goes well and is up to what they say on their blog post, this could entirely replace Pocket for me.</p>

<p>So, you’ve got an e-Bike. Good for you. I’m jealous. You’ve got an Apple Watch too. Good for you, just like me. Now you want to go for a ride and record this activity with your Apple Watch. Which activity type will you select? Selecting <em>Bike</em> will probably record wrong data as you can move much faster than a regular bike and getting lower than normal heartbeat rate. Should Apple provide another type of biking activity?</p>

<p>I was at the office. A normal day. It was a perfect sunny and more than usual mild September day. Blue sky. Then the news struck. At first, I didn’t understand what was actually happening. The internet went slow, to the point of becoming unusable. My colleagues started to leave their desks. We all turned to the TV set in the employees cafeteria. It was such a unique accident, we all thought. Then, the second plane, which marked a turning point in our history of modern barbarism. We are still trying to recover from it. I think of this day so often, each time with deception and bitterness because <a href="https://apple.news/AAJ6-Fv7HSzS1jiz13apuSg">we didn’t learned the right lessons</a>.</p>
<p>Side note: I find the American society fascinating. They seems to treat those who died on 9-11 differently then those who die each year from guns. The latter are more than three times those who died on 9-11. Each year. The US spent close to 6 000 billions dollars on war since 2001. It didn’t fix anything. How much do they spend on guns to try to fix this problem? Fascinating indeed.</p>

<p>Consider this screenshot of the Medium.app updates streak. It’s not a joke. At least one update a week for reimagining their app. I used to like Medium but their app, probably a major conduit to their content, is broken on the iPad and it never gets fixed (mainly layout issues).</p>
<p>How are we supposed to take online publishers seriously when for months they let bugs hinder the user experience of… reading their content? I greatly reduced my use of Medium for reading content, partly because of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to various challenges of COVID-19 and the recent announcement from Apple on their transition away from x86 to Apple Silicon, VMware will no longer pursue hardware certification for the Apple 2019 Mac Pro 7,1 for ESXi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is sad news and probably not a surprising news. In early 2020, I came close to buy an entry-level Mac Pro in order to build a lab-in-a-box for experimenting different environments and software, all related to my work. I started <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/?s=sddcbox">this thread</a> on my blog about my SDDCbox project, and was nearly ready to make the decision. Somehow, priorities shifted and I dropped my project entirely.</p>
<p>It is one thing to see new apps being non-native to the Mac, <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/08/12/1password-8-mac-early-access-triggers-an-early-exit/">like 1Password 8</a> and maybe the <a href="https://readwise.io/read">upcoming Readwise Reader</a> app, but it is another when a major player like VMware no longer consider the Mac as a viable platform for things like ESXi. Apple’s transition to its own silicon has obviously something to do with it. The Mac has never been more popular than today, yet, on the software side, I feel there is a “malaise”.</p>

<p>In recent days or weeks, rumours are rampant on the updated design of the Apple Watch: bigger but flatter screen, boxier design are the main themes, with no new health sensors. I’m not so sure about the boxy design. It’s ok for the iPad or the iPhone but for a watch? To me, it could make it less approachable, less jewelry. We’ll see in a few weeks. There is one thing that I’d like to point out about the Series 7: Apple is not only presumably launching an updated design, <strong>they are creating a new price point</strong>. The bigger screen helps legitimate this. They have been doing this since Tim Cook is CEO.</p>

<p>Now what? How will Apple respond? Will they create a different version of iOS for South Korea? Can they simply appeal this law, if such a thing is possible? How is this going to help other countries and parties to go after Apple&rsquo;s practices? How much time will Apple be given to change its practices? Three months? A year? South Korea is probably a small market for Apple compared to other places in the world, but this new law seems like a tsunami in the making.</p>

			 <p>Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/18/ios-15-safari-beta-6">writing</a> about how Apple mostly fixed Safari 15 on iPhone with beta 6 (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The unusual part is that we got to see Apple’s design process play out in public. The Safari team has been kept busy this summer. (There has to be one hell of backstory here, right?)</strong> There was a certain pessimism amongst some who perceived the problems with the original iOS 15 Safari design, simply because Apple seldom makes drastic UI changes between their unveiling at WWDC in June, and when they officially ship in the fall. But seldom isn’t never.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d love to read the behind-the-scene-story about this “in public” design process that we all witnessed. The Safari team surely scrambled to fix the design issues between beta 1 and beta 6… or was just all planned in advance? I bet on the former. The whole saga was unusual for Apple. They look less confident from a design perspective.</p>
<p>I love Safari 15 in beta 6. They nailed it, and it is an improvement compared to the pre-iOS 15 implementation.</p>

<p>iOS 15 beta 6 is out and Apple is making great progress with Safari on iPhone. For me, they finally hit the right notes. I think that’s the design they should have included since day one of iOS 15. Yet, I find it funny to see Apple put a new option in settings for those who prefer the pre-iOS 15 release. I guess it’s another case of “If you can’t decide which design is the best, just add another option in Settings so the user decide.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>macOS Big Sur did a great job of refining the Mac desktop, but it didn’t fundamentally change any of its behavior. We’d like to see that change with the next version of macOS. With Monterey being mostly full of small refinements rather than big ideas, we’d expect Mammoth to be a monstrous release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m using one of his screen design that pertains to widgets improvements. I recently <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/08/11/what-widgets-on-macos-big-sur-should-have-been/">wrote</a> about those and Apple’s sad design decision to keep them in the notifications center for Big and Monterey. I think Ortolani’s design is interesting and plausible. Freedom of placement certainly makes the experience more satisfying. It’s so true they liberated widgets on iPad with iPadOS 15.</p>
<p>There is so much work going into these visual essays. I mean, there are release notes too! I often considered people doing these mockups has being Apple’s cheap labour. I wonder if Apple’s designers notice those.</p>

<p>I got the new Magic Keyboard with Touch ID. I chose the one without the numeric keypad; the desk space being scarce. Setting this thing up took one minute. I had to read the (slim) manual as I wasn’t sure how the pairing would work: connect the keyboard to my M1 Mac mini with the provided USB-C to Lightning cable, quickly press the M1 Mac mini power button two times to trigger the setup process for Touch ID configuration (Bluetooth is automatically configured). The Touch ID setup screen looks similar to the one on the iPhone when settings up Touch ID for the first time. It’s one of the best Apple keyboard; keys feeling is similar to the previous generation. Touch ID is the star of the show here, and I love it. Only works with M1 Macs. This Magic Keyboard brings to the Mini, a feature otherwise only available to the MacBooks (and the M1 iMac). That’s why I bought the keyboard. It’s not cheap, but convenience has a price for Apple.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, Apple made some changes to their website with the introduction of a new Store tab at the top of their website. Not only that, but the store design has been completely redone. I find it a bit disorienting at first, but after a few minutes, I think the elements and general reorganization make sense; I find it easier to navigate in general. Apple chose the horizontal scrolling sections instead of going vertical. I’m not always sure this is the best way to go, though. The bouncing effect is inconsistent, it’s there while going to the right but not when hitting the limit on the left. AirTags have their section, which is surprising for such a small device.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note that Apple’s top navigation bar is now spanning a store, physical products, services, support, search, and a shopping cart.</p>
<p>Apple is getting ready for this fall slew of new products. Oh, one of the first thing I noticed is that the Magic Keyboard With Touch ID that is bundled with the 24” iMac is now sold separately. I ordered one for my M1 Mac mini. It will take less space on my desk and Touch ID will so much more convenient for the mini. One last thing: convenience has a price: 179 CAN$. Ouch.</p>

			 <p>Matt Birchler had an interesting <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/my-2013-iphone-home-screen/">blog post</a> this week about a screenshot of his 2013 iPhone home screen. There are a few interesting things to note. In 2013, it was the arrival of the controversial iOS 7 redesign. It&rsquo;s interesting to look at the Camera+ icon design which was still not updated for the new style. The dock design style was pretty basic and felt out of place. A few apps are not longer among us these days: Path (which was really a great design example) but most of the third-party apps are still available today.</p>
<p>I wish I had kept screen shots of previous home screen arrangements in the past. Something that I have kept is many screen shots of my password manager user interface dating back pre-iOS 7 era. Here is an example below. When I saw iOS 7, I didn’t have the courage to rework my design. The development of my app stopped right there. I made five thousands dollars with this adventure, between 2009 and 2013. Now I’m using a combinaison of 1Password and Apple’s passwords vault.</p>

<p>I’m going to jump in because on macOS, I don’t see the change as controversial as on iOS 15. I find it surprising that Apple seeks feedback on the new design. It’s a good thing but also surprising has they tend to do their thing alone. Now, they look a bit in distress while searching for a solution.</p>

<p>I sure wish we had this four days work week. I cannot see the day it will become reality. The problem in IT where I work, there is a worsening trend of a lack of qualified people for many IT fields. This trend puts pressure on those who are qualified to do more working hours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As I buy more and more Apple products, all of those Apple products get better. My iPhone is more valuable because of the HomePod Mini I AirPlay my podcast to while I’m working. My iPad gets more valuable because it has seamless file sync with my Mac. Reminders is better because it works with Siri in a way no other app is allowed. The list goes on. But this is of course also a bit of a trap. I can’t really get an Android phone, even if I think I would enjoy it more than my iPhone, because then my HomePods become worse, my Mac gets worse, my iPad gets worse, and my Apple services get worse. Because each additional Apple product makes all my other Apple products better, likewise removing something from that mix brings down everything else.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You cannot use an Apple Watch with an Android smartphone. In Apple&rsquo;s garden, every product has an extension that takes the form of a service or another physical product from Apple. Did we forget that once upon a time we made a switch from platforms like Windows or OS/2? When a new offering is really making a difference, we tend to switch. Back in the days, a Windows PC was an island, leaving it for the Mac meant that you had to re-buy new software, a few accessories. All things equal, the switch wasn&rsquo;t necessarily funny. Today&rsquo;s digital world is quite different, for sure, but pose a similar kind of challenge when switching.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been using Photos in iPadOS 15 since beta 2 and I must say that Apple is in fact offering a major update to their photos application. Beyong the updated Stories automatic creation and management improvements, face recognition has become quite impressive. According to a <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/recognizing-people-photos">published article</a> by Apple, people faces should be more detectable and recognizable in more extreme conditions. I can confirm this is actually the case. A large number of new photos were surfaced by Photos’ improved algorithms which brings more potential content for new stories creation. Managing tagged faces is easier too and provides a refined experience overvall. Photos enhancements in iPadOS 15 is a big reason to upgrade.</p>

A few takeaways: it&rsquo;s a tricky process involving many folders to copy (presets, settings, photos, catalog, etc.). Lightroom is bad at managing digital assets when things need to be reorganized. The Apple Silicon optimized version is faster but not as much as I thought it would be. My Mac mini never stop to impress me, it&rsquo;s such a fast device.

While it is probably based on their previous offering, Windows Virtual Desktop service, it does look like a milestone to me. I’ve been in IT for more than 25 years. I saw the migration from the mainframe to the client-server applications architecture. After that, it was about virtualization taking over with the popular VMware hypervisor. In the last five years, I saw the cloud taking over the IT world. The latter has a much more profound impact than any trend I witnessed or was part of in my career.</p>
<p>PC in the cloud is only offered to business customers, for now. I can see Microsoft offering the service to the general public in a not too distant future. I’ll probably subscribe to an instance for my personal needs. Being able to run the PC in a browser means being able to use it on any of my current Apple devices, from the M1 Mac mini to my iPad Pro. This is something Apple will never enable itself, certainly not within Safari. The future looks interesting.</p>

<p>Wow, that one is close to being hilarious. Big tech companies are the target of hate these days. Google was hit by another antitrust lawsuit by no less than 36 states about their handling of applications side loading on Android. In summary, it is so cumbersome to side load an app on Android, thanks to security measures, that it makes it hard for competing App Store to compete.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google makes the sideloading process unnecessarily cumbersome and impractical by adding superfluous, misleading, and discouraging security warnings and by deterring users by requiring them to grant permission multiple times for a single app installation (discussed in more detail in Sections I.C. and I.D. below). The effect of Google’s conduct is to practically eliminate competition in Android app distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Android is supposedly more permissive than Apple’s App Store and yet, it looks like it’s not enough. This lawsuit is a prime example on why I don’t like the current trend. People want more open platforms but it’s never enough. If Apple is ever forced to make profound changes to their App Store business, it will be the beginning of a worrisome trend that I prefer wouldn’t happen. I recently wrote about not wanting another Android platform. Now, I should say that I don’t want another Windows platform disguised in a mobile device. To me, it is scary and close in nature to the same problem of who should own encryption keys. Raging ransomeware cyberattacks are signs of what is coming on mobile devices if we open them up too much, just like Windows.</p>

<p>If a software vendor like Skylum is unable to update their apps in a timely matter, more than a year after the M1 chip has been announced, I give up. It is sad because these are the kind of applications that would take advantage of the power of the M1 chip. Too bad.

			 <p>The next step for Apple is to design for repairability which goes beyond recycling. AirPods are the worst example of this. When the battery life on these is reached, there is no practical way to replace them without throwing it to the trash and buying a new one. So for me, the right to repair goes way beyond having a choice of where I’m going to take a device for repair. It is about buying a device that was designed for and built to use recycled materials, but also it is about buying a device that can be repaired for basic things like battery replacement.</p>

			 <p>Since last year, I’ve been making a <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/">major cleanup of my Twitter account.</a> I came from following more than 2000 people down to less than 300… and my goal is to drop below 100. I’m slowly getting there. Here are a few take outs from this major cleanup of my accounts following list.</p>
<p>First, there are a lot of stale accounts on Twitter, which tends to artificially increase “followship”. It looks like people stopped tweeting a while ago — they left the building. Second, a bunch of accounts were iPhone developers that I started following during my indie developer era, back in 2009-2013. My interests have since then shifted to writing and blogging. I no longer need to get in touch with the developers community. Third, and this coud be the most troubling take out: Twitter has become less and less useful in my numeric life. Articles readings happens more and more though RSS feeds and Mailbrew. So, what’s left for me from Twitter? Getting reactions from people during specials events, related to Apple’s announcements. That’s pretty much it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a bit late on this one but, let say Apple does go ahead and allow for side loading of apps. Besides the proliferation of App Stores, what will we get in this scenario that we don’t get today? Proponents of applications sideloading are always shy on providing the real long term benefits of such opening. Let me guess: lower prices for apps? Faster install? Better layout App Stores? Apps that use private APIs? What examples of previsouly missed innovations that we get with side-loading? Apps that can trick differently users in thinking they are safe? Or is this choices for the sake of choice?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did the pandemic make a foundational change to the way we think about where we do our jobs? Or was this a blip, with a slow slide back to the old ways?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I certainly hope that we won’t return massively to the old days. For Apple, it looks like the pandemic was a blip and employees will need to be back at the office at least three days a week. It’s a corporate culture thing, which doesn’t get amended easily. Now, for employees not wanted to return to the previous model, even partially, they could become poaching targets by other companies where remote work is fundamental to them. This is where Apple could have to open up more.</p>

			 <p>So Windows 11 is a thing. Is it a revolution to Windows? Maybe, maybe not. It depends if you can install it on your PC, which is far from certain. But let’s say you can, how deep goes the UI refresh? Is it like it was for Windows 10 which was supposedly a redesign of Windows 8 which was tweaks to Windows 7 UI that came before it. Here is a simple question: Did Microsoft really clean up the Windows <a href="https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/2021/02/06/state-of-the-windows-how-many-layers-of-ui-inconsistencies-are-in-windows-10/">UI mess that it has become over the years</a>?

As much as things like AR and LiDAR technology help bring real world and virtual world closer together, UI design seems to go the opposite direction. Why is that?

			 <p>So, I took the plunge and installed <strong>iPadOS 15 beta2</strong> on my iPad Pro. A few observations. It’s beta and it shows. Home screen and widgets placement is janky. One springboard crash so far. All my apps are working just fine. <strong>Battery life</strong> is taking a hit. <strong>Text recognition</strong> in pictures is jaw breaking and open up all sort of new use cases. The <strong>QuickNote</strong> feature is a nice addition that will complement my blogger workflow. QuickNotes appear as regular notes on iOS 14. The <strong>loupe</strong> is back, thanks god, but I think refinements are needed: it is hard to distinguish from the surrounding text. I completely redone my home screen arrangment. I didn’t setup <strong>Focus modes</strong> yet as I’m not done with home screens setup yet, both are tied together. I love the new notifications design. I’m really liking iPadOS 15 so far. I use <strong>App Library</strong> a lot, much more than on my iPhone. 1x1 Widgets are replacing application icons on my first home screen page and I love it! Reordering of home pages is alone enough to justify upgrading! Didn’t use the new multitasking a lot yet, just played a bit with it and it’s a good improvement. Alt-tab in split-view will switch focus between the apps, welcome in 2021. Unpopular opinion: I kind of like <strong>Safari’s new design</strong>, not sure if this will hold true on the iPhone, though. I love the new keyboard overlay at the bottom of the screen; it is no longer as wide as the screen. I like the refreshed design of the <strong>shortcuts editor</strong> and the suggestions. That’s it for now. Back to home pages setup.</p>

Apparently, hackers came in by using an unpatched vulnerability on devices where the last update was issued in 2015 by Western Digital. This brings me to ask the following questions: were those devices directly connected on the internet? If yes, that dumb. If this was a known vulnerability, why WD didn&rsquo;t issue a patch? Companies should be required to publish security-only fixes for far longer than they do right now. I&rsquo;m sorry but 2015 isn&rsquo;t that old for such a type of devices. Finally, I personally own a Synology NAS, obviously not directly  connected on the Internet, yet, I have to wonder if it is still secure.

Beta 2 came late this week and reports are starting to come in. In summary, lot’s of fixes, a bit faster and apparently no big show stopper. I’m mostly using Craft these days and Apple’s stock apps like Reminders and Notes. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>My situation is similar to <a href="http://ipadinsight.com/apple-news/waiting-for-the-beta/">James Rogers’ from iPadInsight</a>. Last year, I went all in with iOS 14 betas on my iPad and iPhone. This year? I’m a bit more caution. I’m looking to test iPadOS more than anything. As I write this, I get a feeling that I’m trying to convince myself of either waiting for the public beta of simply live dangerously and make the plunge. But what happens in Photos memories on non-upgraded devices? What about Messages in the cloud? What if I create a new reminder item on iOS 15 but want to check it off on a non-iOS 15 device? So many questions… Help me with this.</p>
<p>I know that I should put some time in writing my next issue of my monthly newsletter instead of writing this microblog post. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<p>Just got an idea: have a look at the release notes and see if there are any deal breaker in there. Stay tuned. 😅</p>

			 <p>Benjamin Mayo on FaceTime 15 in the landscape of collaboration tools like Zoom and Teams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FaceTime is more like an add-on of Messages, competing against WhatsApp and traditional phone calls if anything. You also see this in how each service handles identity; Zoom and Teams have abstracted user accounts, whereas on FaceTime you connect by sharing your personal phone number or email address — information that you only want to give out to close friends.
Source: <a href="https://bzamayo.com/ios-15-facetime">FaceTime in iOS 15 — Benjamin Mayo</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, to use FaceTime, you need to give very personal information like your phone number of your email address… while other competing platform has abstracted that account information a long time ago. <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-create-facetime-call-link-iphone-and-ipad">FaceTime links</a> represent a step in the right direction, as sharing a link is enough for others to get onboard.

Apple’s intention was two-fold: provide a better navigation on the iPhone with the thumb and bring the navigation model of switching across open websites closer to switching between apps. Apple’s intention were good but where they fail is to provide the exact same design for things like opened tabs the same across all screen sizes. It’s probably not needed on the Mac, it’s good on the iPad but messy on the iPhone. I wonder how Apple will backtrack on this one and when.</p>

Oh and clusless IT guys who will require those apps to be downloaded because, you know, they are mandatory for this or that… schools would probably be the first in line…. wake up guys, we don’t need this shitty world.</p>

			 <p>This is one of the many reasons why I love Apple. They put so much money into this <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-tower-theatre-opens-thursday-in-downtown-los-angeles/">building restoration</a>, it is mind blowing. The amounf of efforts that went into renovating this historic site is beyond any public-founded projects could have done. This brings me to this interesting question by <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/apple-tower-theatre">Basic Apple Guy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(…) should corporations be allowed to get their hands on this historic architecture and turn them into private businesses? Rightly or wrongly, the fact of the matter is that many governments don&rsquo;t prioritize or have the means to prioritize the extensive work required to take on this scale of restoration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tend to have a polarizing view on anything related to architecture. My father was an architect and so I’m profoundly sensitive on the subject. Yes corporation can take over abandoned historic buildings as long as they do it under the supervision of an urbanism council or something like it. Here, Apple transformed a building into a store but each time Apple chose to do it in a gentle way. I mean, it is barely noticeable from the outside that this is an Apple Store. It’s a very respectful way to do it.</p>

Without trying to read too much in these numbers, I think the next major revision of Apple’s flagship operating systems will grow on people when they start to use them.</p>
<p>There are some profound changes like focus modes that has the potential to change the way we use our iPhone or iPad. It’s hard to judge this feature just by looking at YouTube videos. The new focus mode certainly requires a bit of setup and tuning but me feeling is that it will have a much profound impact on users than what multi-users support could have brought to the table.</p>

<p>How much Apple business did represent to Intel overall numbers before the Apple Silicon transition started? My feeling is that it wasn&rsquo;t that big. Ten pourcent, maybe?

<p>This take from Gruber “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut">App Store: The Schiller Cut</a>” has a sour taste following the WWDC keynote and Platforms state of the union. Did Apple announce something this week to appease developers relations? Nope. Will they announce something in the coming weeks in regard to App Store commissions? Who knows. If they do, they will do it in a position of weakness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someday down the road we will be changing 70/30, then I think the question moves from “if” to “when” and “how”. I’m not suggesting we do anything differently today, only that whenever we make a change we do it from a position of strength rather than weakness. That we use any such change to our advantage if possible. And thinking about this long in advance can only help to look at an eventual change as an opportunity (with developers, press, customers, etc). — Phil Schiller in 2011</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They missed the opportunity this year. Apple is in a weak position and I don’t see how this could change anytime soon.</p>

			 <p>With Adobe finally releasing Lightroom Classic for Apple Silicon Macs, This could enable me to move off my 2017 21.5” Intel Mac for once. The prospect of Lightroom catalogs and data migration is not enchanting though. There the issues of plugins migration too. Is it time for me to go all-in cloud with Lightroom CC only? Not sure it is the right time either.</p>
<p>I have a few incentives for selling my iMac: one being to help me finance a shiny new 2021 12.9” iPad Pro with 1 TB of RAM. This could serve as my iPadOS 15 test bed for the second half of summer. I still have quite some time to think about all this as these devices are back-ordered for at least the second half of July.</p>

			 <p>After publishing my essay on what I was hoping Apple would do in response to the developers community, Matt Birchler wrote a small response regarding my assertion about payments processing platform being a limited feature in the grand scheme of things. It appears I was wrong. Thanks to Matt <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/payment-processing-is-not-a-commodity/">blog post</a>, I have a better view of what goes behind the scene here.</p>
<p>That being said, Apple’s payment processing service within the App Store serves Apple&rsquo;s purposes and is the one that is very narrow, very focused. It&rsquo;s a good thing. I&rsquo;m not sure Apple has to compete against this industry. Allowing third-party payment processing services would need to focus on the minimum in order to protect privacy or help guarantee that privacy is in good hands. It&rsquo;s an attainable goal.</p>

<p>Consider the previous screenshot showing the popup menu when selecting a word in a document. This menu hasn’t been touched since iOS 3, if I remember correctly. Tomorrow, as we are about to get a peek at iPadOS 15 and iOS 15, I’m wondering if there are better ways to display such a menu. Consider a few design problems and possible improvements.</p>
<p>This menu doesn’t scale well; it isn’t exactly elegant. In some situations, we have to scroll through its options which is not always obvious and is tricky to do with the finger without selecting the option at touch and scroll time. Also, this design involves too much finder travel to my taste; I would prefer a more condensed version. The design is flat and doesn’t allow for hierarchical grouping of options which could help is situations where many options are available. The design is flat and is not as distinctive as it could be. Adding some depth, contour line would help.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions on how Apple could improve on this?</p>

<p>The Thunderbolt display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/apple-thunderbolt-display-now-considered-vintage/">is now a vintage product</a> for Apple. When I look at this beautiful monitor, I’m thinking about the recently introduced redesigned iMac. Many people would have preferred to see the iMac chin disappear. We should know better and see this is a distinctive design attribute of the iMac which make it look different than from a simple monitor. It’s an important visual differentiation factor in my opinion. The iMac is not a simple monitor.</p>

These kinds of “in-and-out” apps are exceptional for Slide Over.</p>

<p>At least one person really likes multitasking on iPadOS. The thing about the Slide over feature is that it requires setting it up. It doesn’t happen “just like that”. I rarely find the right app to use in the Slide over view… I need to “bring it in” and this is where the experience falls apart. This is where I want to see Apple improve things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This problem isn’t unique to Apple. Most, if not all, of the major companies whose products and services we interact with each day are being influenced by China. And I expect that influence is growing with each day that passes. If you’re in favor of freedom, liberty, and individual rights, you should be concerned about this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s refreshing to see that Apple isn’t the only one where its products are made and a lot of them are sold to. What can we do instead of just bashing on Apple?</p>

<p>The elephant in the room is iPadOS. It’s just not good enough. In the same way that Intel’s chips were holding back Macs, iPadOS has been holding back iPad Pros. With Intel chips, the hardware was holding back the Mac platform. With iPads, it’s the software holding the platform back. This hardware is indisputably amazing, and iPadOS is fine for casual use. But it still feels like I’m trying to do fine detail work while wearing oven mitts for my day-to-day work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like Gruber’s introduction in his review of the M1 iPad Pro. But his review echos other reviews. Nearly all M1 iPad Pro reviews that I have read note the same issue: iPadOS lacks maturity to sustain iPad Pro aspirations. Can’t wait for Apple’s WWDC in three weeks.</p>

<p>According to circulating rumours, the Apple Series 7 will go through a small redesign. The Series 4 introduced a bigger screen but the overall shape stayed the same. This time, a more boxy look is expected. I’m not sure that I like what I’m seeing here on this mock-up. To me, the Apple Watch would loses some of its iconic traits. If this boxy design allows for more internal space, hence probably more sensors or new features, better battery life, so be it.</p>

<p>One question: why announce these initiatives now? We’re 17 days away from WWDC. Looks like WWDC will have more room to announce even more exciting stuff. 😀</p>
<p>Another question: if you look at the following screenshot taken from today’s announcement, we can see that table cells are narrower than what we have on iOS 14. Is this a first glimpse of what is coming in iOS 15? I certainly hope so because it looks much better, friendlier. It reminds me of the pre-iOS 7 era.</p>

<p>The <strong>“one chip SKU to rule them all”</strong> won’t last forever it seems. Apple will take advantage of its ability to decide what goes in its chips to help differentiate each models within the same product line. We already witness this with the 7-core vs 8-core variant of the M1 chip in the 2021 iMac, but this variability will increase over time. My hope is that Apple doesn’t try to hard to be greedy with this strategy and keep the product&rsquo;s differentiation simple to grasp.</p>

<p>Ah, ah, another moment of Apple’s Bluetooth device not working as expected. Since I got my 2017 21.5” iMac, I’ve experienced unstable Bluetooth connectivity with Apple’s mouse and keyboard. I don’t know when it started, if it’s related to a certain release of macOS, but it is happening all the time. The worst part is the mouse being jerky while moving on the screen. Bluetooth&rsquo;s instabilities also impact my AirPods usage with the Mac. My AirPods simply drops from receiving the Mac audio while in Zoom meetings. It is infuriating. Eventually, I need to reboot the Mac to reset the Bluetooth stack.</p>
<p>When I got the M1 Mac mini, I thought Bluetooth connectivity issues would be a thing of the past. I couldn’t be more wrong. It was worst. The mouse and the keyboard are both having instabilities. They need to be turned off and on to temporarily fix the problem, but eventually the Mac needs a full reboot. Again, this is exasperating. It is a well documented issue which macOS 11.1 and 11.2 tried to fix but the problems still happen, albeit a bit less often.</p>
<p>There is something wrong with Apple’s Bluetooth implementation in general. Is it the driver, the firmware, the chip, a combination of these that is at fault? I don’t know but the fact that this shiny new iMac with the wireless keyboard with TouchID stops working like Gruber experienced is not a good sign.</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk regarding the white bezel of the new iMac. I still don’t know what to think about them. They make it look like if there was a white masking tape all around the display. But the thing is, considering the fact that Apple’s macOS overall user interface is so “white-ish” in general, this should help make the bezel kind of disappear in reality and just be an extension of the user interface.</p>

<p>The iPad is a mighty device considering its form-factor. Many people are asking for Apple to make Xcode available for the iPad. I wonder: who are asking for this? Are they serious developers or just hobbyists? I would find it surprising if it was the former because there can be so many tools besides Xcode that is needed I order to build an app, and not all those things are available on the iPad. Serious developers would need to bring in a Mac to complete the development picture. If this is the hobbyists, does it even matter?</p>
<p>Would it be the full version of Xcode or a diminutive version? If it is the latter, what kind of apps would it be able to create, and what are the others it wouldn’t? Would it be Swift-only with SwiftUI? If that’s the case, are we in the “tech proof of concept” territory or if it is a viable path going forward? What would iPadOS 15 need to make Xcode for iPad a viable solution? Better file management? External monitor support? A link to a Mac for certain tasks and features? Is the 12.9” iPad Pro the only supported device or is the 11” version be supported too?</p>
<p>If you are a developer reading this post, would you use Xcode for iPad to build your apps if Apple made it available?</p>

<p>But what if you could add other kinds of things to your Home Screen too? (&hellip;) Apple could add the same ‘Add to Home Screen’ button to the share sheet in Music, in Podcasts, in News, and in TV. Each content type could have a distinct shape for differentiation. Albums, podcasts and publications could have more squared off icons. Magazines could be more narrow to show off covers. TV Shows and movies could use the same artwork that appears in app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frankly, I <strong>love</strong> this idea. On the iPad, it could be the ultimate playground to play with this feature, thanks to the device size. I can see me adding all kind of stuff like my wife iMessage contact, an RSS feed to my favourite content creators, a shortcut to a podcast or an Apple Music playlist or artist. So much possibilities.</p>
<p>The idea of adding all sort of content on the home screen is not new, yet on iOS and iPadOS, current design feels really restricted. We are ready to go to the next phase in evolution. I want freedom in folder size and placement, I want Apple Watch complication-style widgets. I want freedom. Apple, by any chance, are you listening?</p>

<p><strong>Only 17K apps for the Apple Watch??</strong> Calling this a failure is a bit surprising. The Watch is a narrow platform compared to the iPhone, the iPad or the Mac. I don&rsquo;t expect as many apps to be available for the Watch. This form-factor isn&rsquo;t obviously suitable for a lot of applications categories. I think 17K apps is quite a lot actually because I don&rsquo;t get a sense of it when I browse the App Store from the Apple Watch itself or from my iPhone. <em>This is where Apple is failing: discovery of Watch apps is miserable, just like it is in general on Apple&rsquo;s App Store.</em></p>

			 <p>Browsers look more and more like operating systems. Apple knows this, and they are probably afraid for their App Store business.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/">article</a> from Alex Russell of <strong>Infrequently Notes</strong> is very convincing: <em>Apple purposely delay implementation of new web standards to refrain developers to build web applications</em>. New web standards are enablers for new kinds of web applications with richer features set. Those richer apps could go against Apple’s App Store profitable business. No wonder why so many people are using alternative browsers to Safari. But that’s not all. Since Apple, in general is a big player, its influence is unquestionably high, the lack of support from them for so many basic and essential web standards discourage new application opportunities. That’s too bad and makes me wonder how sites like Mailbrew who offers a web application could improve if all browsers, including Safari would support most web standards. Mailbrew is already good on the iPad, closely mimicking a native application, yet I wonder.</p>
<p>Can we hope for changes at the next WWDC conference?</p>

Enough is enough. For those who are ok with hyper targeted ads, fine, but not at this cost. I salute Apple for moving forward with this feature in iOS 14.5. Coupled with services like NextDNS, I’m starting to see quite an improvement in my web surfing experience and being more at ease doing so.</p>

<p><em>“It’s disappointing that the modern Apple is so willing to stonewall, and that it can take an inexcusably long time to set things right.”</em></p>
<p>Mr. Segall piece is baffling. Taken together, those bad apples make Apple look terrible at design. Apple is opinionated and takes bold risks when designing new products and services. This comes at a cost, occasionally. Apple is far from perfect, but they should know that quickly admitting when they fail makes the mistakes more easily forgiven.</p>
<p>What Apple product currently shipping that has baffling design flaws for which Apple doesn’t seem to care fixing, beside the Magic Mouse? I don’t see that many as they silently fixed most of them in recent years.</p>

			 <p>Surprisingly, <strong>Apple&rsquo;s Night Shift</strong> does not help in any way to fall asleep, according to a study. Intuitively, I thought of the opposite. When Apple launched this feature, in 2016, they said it would help. It seems it&rsquo;s not the case after all. Will they backtrack and remove the feature in a future version? I highly doubt it. Many people do like this feature (I do on the iPhone, I hate it on the Mac), others like <a href="https://micro.blog/Gruber">@Gruber</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/04/byu-night-shift">don&rsquo;t</a>. What I don&rsquo;t like is when the feature is in action, opening Photos abruptly turn the visual effect off. The effect is brutal as the screen turns blueish and cold because of the contrasting mode. I would prefer a more gentle disabling of the feature.</p>

<p>One evidence taken out of the <strong>Epic vs Apple trial</strong> yesterday, the above email. This email from Mr. Schiller shows how unhappy he was with scam apps being #1 on the App Store. His numerous questions are expressing frustrations. He saw what we keep seeing all too often today, nine years later. So, where are the reviewers? What value are they adding to the user experience’s bottom line? Apple could strictly rely on machine-based curation only instead, but they prefer the added touch of human-based curation for the editorial content. Does it make a real difference? On the surface maybe. With the scale of the App Store, cracks are obviously possible, hence bas actors are taking advantage of them, to create scams one after another.</p>
<p>Apple doesn’t look good because some of their arguments aren’t backed with proven and irrefutable facts. As a gatekeeper of the quality on the App Store, Apple is failing. Big time. From scams apps to badly designed ones, to never updated ones, beneath the front page surface, the App Store feels and look like a junkyard.</p>

			 <p>I never bought so many applications and utilities or subscribed to so many services since the beginning of the pandemic. For the latter, I had to use Apple’s Number just to keep track of all of them😳🤪. Because I’m working from home since March 2020, my work-related expanses are close to zero. I don’t go buy a coffee or snacks in the middle of the workday as I used to. I don’t buy transportation titles anymore. I no longer commute. Furthermore, I no longer travel. My home office setup upgrade is complete. This mean that I have more to spend on something else. I’m more inclined to buy digital goods. Some are impulse buys. That’s why I invested in many macOS applications and utilities which gave me the idea of writing this article “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/04/11/tips-tricks-utilities-for-boosting-your-productivity-with-apple-macos-big-sur/" title="Tips &amp; Tricks &amp; Utilities for Boosting Your Productivity with Apple’s macOS Big Sur">Tips &amp; Tricks &amp; Utilities for Boosting Your Productivity with Apple’s macOS Big Sur</a>”.</p>
<p>I don’t know if a return to normal will push me to cancel any of my applications or utilities subscriptions. I don’t think so as I think they are needed and useful to my blogger workflow. I return to this commuting world as I’ll keep working from home forever. I’m not alone and this makes me wonder how profound changes caused by this pandemic could be on so many economic levels.</p>

<p>The way I look at this upcoming <strong>M1 iPad Pro</strong> is, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/interview-apple-executives-on-the-2021-ipad-pro-stunting-with-the-m1-and-creating-headroom/">this interview with some Apple’s top brass</a>, Apple thinks that, by building a powerful iPad (not referred as a tablet), developers will find a way to take advantage of it. Like the old saying: build it and they will come. Did Apple create performance headroom for themselves too, not just for third-party developers? Apple certainly wants some form of future proofing with this year’s iterative design. I’m still pondering the idea of buying such big iPad while keeping my “older” 2018 11” iPad Pro, it will depends of iPadOS 15.</p>

			 <p>According to the infamous Bloomberg (remember the Big Hack story?), <strong>iOS 15</strong> and <strong>iPadOS 15</strong> will bring two much requested features. One is, for the iPhone presumably, is a redesigned Lock Screen. I’m in for that one. In fact, I would prefer a customizable Lock Screen, more than a redesign. But, the most interesting part is regarding the iPad. At long least, Apple is about to bring the full widgets experience on the iPad. YES! I do have high hopes for that one. Having full liberty on widgets placement on the iPad screen will be transformative. Even better if they support some form of minimal interactions with the applications behind them. Can’t wait for WWDC 21.</p>

<p>This is one of those days where it will be hard to stay focused, thanks to <strong>the first Apple Event of 2021</strong>. I’ve got a pretty busy schedule at work, so I won’t be able to catch the live feed with full attention this time around. I know that all these notifications will spoil the show. Rumours and leaks already made a great job already, though. But, what if there is “one more thing”?</p>
<p>Tonight, I’ll catch it all up, partially knowing most of the takeaways. It will be weird. Who likes to go see a movie knowing the story line in advance? I hate that. 😒</p>

<p>Since Jony Ive left Apple, a few years ago, the iPhone design adopted an opposite trend of becoming fatter and fatter. It’s not a night and day difference but there is a trend. It is a welcomed one because this gives Apple more “room” to improve the cameras and the battery life. Speaking of the cameras, did you see the camera assembly protuberance on the CAD designs? It is getting bigger too, that I don’t like.</p>

<p>Tonight, using Craft, I’m writing my next piece for “<a href="https://numericcitizen.io">Numeric Citizen I/O</a>” on my 2018 11’’ iPad Pro with the Apple Magic Keyboard. I’m being this multitasking guy as I’m constantly switching between Craft, Soundcloud, Twitter, Safari, Ulysses, etc. Then, suddenly, my thoughts goes toward imagining what can Apple do to make me upgrade to the next iPad Pro.</p>
<p>You see, my current setup is near perfect for my needs and my current use cases. I’m far from maximizing this iPad’s potential. So, ask me again, why should I upgrade to what’s coming next week? I cannot see anything. Maybe Apple has a few well hidden cards, just waiting to be played, one by one at next week’s virtual event. We shall see soon.</p>

<p>At long last, Apple is calling the first virtual event of 2021 for next week. I have mixed up feelings about this one. AirTags, if they are real, aren’t game changer and really are complementary to anything Apple is doing these days.</p>
<p>I wrote a few times that for the iPad, the next major step won’t come in the form of hardware upgrades but in software, with iPadOS 15. And this, happens every year on June at the WWDC conference. So, unless there is a last minute surprise from Apple’s updated iPad Pro, my attention will be for the next WWDC, not this spring event.</p>
<p>Oh, about this rumoured iMac redesign, THIS I will be looking forward to it, but somehow, I think it is more a WWDC thing than anything else.</p>

<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/59af83bbcb.jpg" alt="New App Store icon design language?"></p>
<p>I rarely comment on rumours from highly speculative reports, but this report from MacRumors is different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Apple Music for Artists app now features a simpler, streamlined icon with a pinkish red music logo rather than the multicolored logo that was used before. The icon also has an embossed look that makes it stand out from other Apple icons.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“App Store Connect in October was updated with a refreshed icon that&rsquo;s similar to the ‌Apple Music‌ for Artists icon, which means Apple has now updated two app icons with this new design.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simple fact that two icons got updated with similar look at several months interval could signal a trend leading to the upcoming design update with iOS 15. I much prefer the right version of these icons, particularly the embossed design. This 3D effect adds some depth and dynamism to the design, and yes I like the fine line marking the icon boundaries.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if those two icons were part of an A/B testing program, within Apple. Second, what Apple has done with macOS Big Sur was only the beginning destined to encompass all platforms, in some form or another (icon design wise).</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/464f6488e1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There is a lot to like in the recent Tim Cook’s interview with Kara Swisher (<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-apples-privacy-push-facebooks-existential-threat/id1528594034?i=1000515797139">link to Podcast</a>). It’s a must-listen. Here are a few observations and remarks.</p>
<ol>
<li>I love Tim Cook’s stance on issues like privacy protection. But at the same time, I have a hard time understanding how Apple can continue to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/aapl-raised-services-revenue-forecast">sign a search deal with Google</a> while advocating privacy protection. This is simply unsustainable and hard to defend if you ask me. I know… $$$. Yet… will they ever try to make their search engine or buy one like DuckDuckGo and kick Google out as the default search engine? That would be such a powerful message to send.</li>
<li>Today, Apple under Tim Cook, has never been so well positioned to represent the best corporate defender of many of my core values: <strong>privacy protection</strong>, careful <strong>attention to details</strong> in design, openness to <strong>diversity</strong>, <strong>environment</strong> protection, sustainable development, <strong>great user experiences</strong>. Apple is not perfect, far from it. Yet, there is nothing like them these days.</li>
<li>Tim Cook is candidly answering the question of where he sees himself in ten years from now. I wonder what are the plans for his or her successor? Does he and Apple’s upper management actively put as much thought into it as Steve Jobs did in his last few years at Apple? I wonder and I hope this is the case.</li>
<li>This interview maybe <a href="https://www.ped30.com/2021/04/05/apple-cook-swisher-sway/">seen as a bit self-serving</a>, yet it is what it is. We, Apple’s customers like me, pay Apple to make calls on issues like encryption and privacy protection, environmental protection, etc. That’s the way I see my voting dollars anyway. As soon as I like most of their calls, I’ll be fine and be one of their customer. I dearly hope it stays that way because alternatives are scarce to say the least.</li>
<li>Is Apple playing the same rules for ALL developers? I doubt it. Is Apple’s curation of the App Store perfect? Far from it: 80% of the stuff in there is pure junk.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it is important to stay critical about Apple. We must keep them on their toes.</p>

<p>In a word: <strong>Pocket</strong>. I’ve been rediscovering this application in recent days, and I’m loving it a lot. I no longer read articles within Safari or News Explorer. As soon as I think the article is interesting, I save it to Pocket and continue from there. The reading experience is simple and is frictionless. Being able to tag and highlight each article helps me organize and add value to my readings. Above all, Pocket will become a repository of all my past readings. The recommend feature creates some exposure for the authors. Each of my recommendation is accompanied by some text. I love it.</p>

<p>Today, I have come to realize that, since its introduction, I didn’t see the iPhone 12 lineup in person. It’s the first time that I didn’t go to an Apple Store to see, manipulate and experience a new Apple product release. How big is the Max? How small is the mini? What about this new edge? The same goes for the Mac Pro.</p>
<p>The pandemic has really put a dent in our lives in some unexpected ways, big and small. But, do I really miss something? After all, the iPhone 12 is the return of the beloved iPhone 5, which I owned. I guess I’ll have to wait for the iPhone 13 or whatever it is called.</p>

<p>I’m no musicien. I know barely nothing about music theory. Yet, I always wanted to do some form of music. Synthesizer would be my instrument if I was to do music. Yet, I’ve been fascinated by music, especially electronic music since I was a teenager. I’m a big listener of techno and house music. Recently, I started to use my iPad while exercising on the treadmill to play video on YouTube of DJ doing mixes. This got me curious about the equipments and software DJs are relying on. I downloaded Algoriddim’s Djay app and stared to play with it on my iPad. I was really excited. I started to read more about the world of music mixing. So, I learned about DJ mixer, controllers, DJ software, music sources, digital record pools, file formats, MIDI, etc. Then, yesterday, unexpectedly, while visiting a music instruments store to see these equipments in person, I bought a Pioneer DDJ-400, a pair of small speakers, went home, enabled a trial of <a href="https://www.algoriddim.com/apps">Djay Pro AI</a> on my iPad Pro and started to plug all the pieces together. I feel like it’s Christmas time. Will see where it goes from here. Expect more details on my endeavour soon.</p>

<p>Apple just kicked off the 2021 season of high expectations, endless wishes lists, criticism, betas, crashes, deception, no-show products, expected hardware refreshes, iPad deceptions, etc. Again, this year, it will be a digital-only version, thanks to the lingering COVID-19 pandemic. I’m happy with that. As I wrote in the past, my hope is that this type of event stays digital. I’ve never been to a real WWDC so I don’t miss anything.</p>
<p>Now, trying to read into WWDC’s announcement art: sure, there is this reference to last year’s Craig Federighi with its MacBook Air, but it is also clear to me that Apple is set to announce their <strong>AR Glasses</strong>. Yep. Remember, you read it here first guys. 😜</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple needs to release new products to compete in the home. Be it an &ldquo;Apple TV 6&rdquo; or &ldquo;HomeHub,&rdquo; something needs to change the customer&rsquo;s perspective in order to get traction in the space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article fails to mention a feature a <strong>HomePod</strong> replacement could and should include: <strong>home networking</strong>. I wrote about this many times. Apple left home networking market at a time where it was transitioning to WIFI 6 and home automation really started to pick up pace, thanks to things like HomeKit.</p>
<p>Mesh networking is something critical these days with the new work-from-home trend caused by the pandemic. Only Apple could create an easy to use networking product, à la Ubiquity or something like the AirPort product line. Speakers like the HomePod mini could evolve to be mesh extenders. I don’t really care if this product does have a screen or multiple mics. Sure it has to be HomeKit integrated. No, I don’T want it to be a successor to the Apple TV. Pricing would be too out of control. It has to be a separate product.</p>
<p>Leaving the home networking space could be one of the worst Apple decision in recent years. We keep seeing the consequences of it now.</p>

<p>According to 9to5Mac, users from Russia, upon setup of their brand-new iPhone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple users will see a dialog box upon initial setup of new devices that features web browsers, antivirus, messenger, email clients, and more to be installed by default. The list of apps is provided by the government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first, I thought it was a bad decision from Apple, to allow this to happen. Bending to state laws from a country like Russia doesn’t look good. Who’s next? China? What about smartphone carriers?</p>
<p>The headlines are scarier than the reality, though. Users will be able to uninstall those state-sponsored apps. Otherwise, it is easy to imagine many scenarios like the dreaded PC bloatware we had to endure in the nineties from Microsoft’s OEMs. Or even worse, what about state surveillance applications? How will Apple say no to those? Are PCs subject to the same requirements? If not, why?</p>
<p>On the flip side, I can see some situations where apps could be suggested that would make sense, like contact tracing apps. It could have made a difference if we had this feature implemented before the pandemic. Another case is to suggest a government sponsored app that gives access to services sponsored by the government (immigration, finance, security, etc.). Finally, what are those apps that will make the list when setting up a new iPhone in Russia? I hope someone will share their experience once the law comes into effect.</p>

<p>Well, rumours abound, changes to the Apple Store options for the iMac, the demise of the iMac Pro, something is really going on with the iMac line. As Apple is currently in the midst of their transition to a full Apple Silicon future for the Mac, we may find what’s coming next, sooner than later.</p>
<p>I always loved the iMac because it is the most truthful version of the Mac original vision. I owned a 24” 2005 white iMac, then a 2007 aluminum version before my current 2017 iMac, on which I work on every weekday, for my day time work. I’m really looking forward for Apple to inject a new dose of design language in general, but especially for the iMac. The chin, the bezels, the rounded back all feel quite dated and tired. The ultimate form factor is to get a screen, nothing more. Think of it like a big iPad Pro on a svelte stand. The next design has to be iconic. It should differentiate itself from the current iPad Pro or the ProDisplay XDR. Apple’s industrial design team must enter new territories, they have to put a clear mark on Jony Ive’s era. Everything in Apple’s current Mac product lines look and feel like Jony Ive’s team work. We are due for a new beginning.</p>
<p>Will this new machine come in April? I feel like Apple should use a more important event like WWDC or one of the fall keynote to release such a landmark product. Current movements on the Apple Store and recent discoveries in Apple’s latest beta software points to a sooner than later release. We shall see very soon, I guess.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Apple has tested ‌iPad‌ Pros with a Thunderbolt connector that would make them compatible with additional external monitors, hard drives, and peripherals, plus it brings faster data syncing speeds. Apple&rsquo;s Mac machines have featured Thunderbolt technology for years now, but current ‌iPad Pro‌ and iPad Air models have standard USB-C ports.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such an iPad feature has to come with much improved operating system support for external devices, like external monitors, which is currently very limited under iPadOS 14.4. Expect an iPadOS 14.5 surprise support (something along he line of mouse support with iPadOS 13.4 at around the same time last year) or iPad 15 with profound improvements compared to iPadOS 14 which was limited in new features.</p>
<p>Personally, the key for a possible upgrade from my 2018 iPadPro lies in the software, not only the hardware. Also, rumours all points to the 12.9” iPad Pro, what about the 11”? I highly wish that Apple will make the 11”, just a smaller version of the 12.9” version.</p>

Not as fun as the “originals”, though, but still. Intel hits the nerves. Intel is playing the Apple playbook, simple as that. It’s an interesting moment, a blip, in the advertising world.

<p>What does the iMac Pro and the HomePod, two entirely different products, have in common? It’s not the fact that they are no longer being sold. <strong><em>The iMac Pro and the HomePod were created by Apple when they were caught off guard by market trends</em></strong>. In the case of the iMac Pro, Apple tried to answer pro users who were demanding a replacement to the aging trash can Mac Pro. Apple didn’t read the temperature room correctly. They acted urgently and responded with the wrong answer, the iMac Pro. The right answer would have been to fix the Mac Pro instead by creating another more modern version of the expandable Mac Pro, which they finally did later in 2019. The HomePod was created when Apple (finally) realized the smart speakers market was a thing. Apple misread the room temperature again with a high-end smart speaker which wasn’t that smart but sounded good. In such a market, pricing is everything.</p>
<p>Apple is at its best when they create products they want to use for themselves, just like they did with the iPhone. The Apple Car is such a thing really exists), the AR glasses (if such a thing really exists) are a potential case of such products. The Apple Watch was also built on the same principles of the iPhone: something they really want to use themselves.</p>
<p>I own two HomePod, paired together and two HomePod mini, placed in two different rooms. I love them all, but I prefer the mini for hard to explain reasons. It is sad to see the HomePro go. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/06/21/replacing-an-airport-extreme-with-unifi-dream-machine/">It could have played so differently</a>.</p>
<p>What’s the next Apple product to be killed? The iPod touch?</p>
<p><strong><em>Afterthought</em></strong>: what is Apple comes out with a new HomePod with an integrated wifi 6 router and maybe some storage, something along the line of the AirPort Extreme a few years ago? A new HomePod mini could also be released with wifi extender built-in. I would buy that in a heartbeat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The level of consumerism and marketing tricks being used to sell apps and services is growing over time. They all promise to fix that gap in your work life, just like adverts promise to fix the one in your love life, or improve your happiness, or whatever it is. It’s all lies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot talk for others, but for me, when I’m jumping on another service or a new app, it’s because it offers a seizable improvement. Going from Notion to Craft is my latest example of such move. I’ll elaborate on this at length in a feature post in the very near future.</p>
<p>I recently wrote “<a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/02/21/are-we-digital.html">Are we digital nomads</a>?” My answer is yes. It seems we cannot stay in one place for a very long time, looking for the new, the latest and greatest, all the time. We’re bored. This is what it is. Form takes over function. Or is it? Again, my blogger workflow is full of moving parts and I consider it is an ongoing experiment.</p>

			 <p><strong>WebP image format</strong> goal, according to Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster. WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG images at equivalent SSIM quality index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen more and more WebP images in recent months when I try to download an image from Safari.

<p>I recently published a long piece about <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/">transforming your Twitter experience by using Twitter lists</a> instead of following a bunch of accounts. As noted in the article, one side effect of this approach is that services that look for your Twitter account’s list of people you follow won’t really work. That’s the case for a new service called “<strong><a href="https://spoonbill.io">Spoonbill</a></strong>”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep updated on your friends&rsquo; and family members&rsquo; bios, websites, locations, and names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spoonbill will send you a summary of changes that occurred on Twitter’s bio of people you follow. I wonder if this service can be tweaked to use Twitter’s lists instead. What about <strong>Mailbrew</strong>, maybe they could come up with a similar feature, which would be really cool.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’m not coming back to following two thousands people.</p>

<p>In recent months, we were approached by a buyer. They saw the uniqueness of Weather Line and the strong foundation we’ve built. While we aren’t able to provide further details on their future plans for the app, we hope you can understand, and will look forward to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m kind of in shock right now. I recently <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/02/03/great-weather-apps-for-weather-enthusiasts/">posted an article about my “go-to” weather applications</a>. <strong>Weather Line</strong> wasn’t part of the line up, but I did have it installed on my iPhone, and I’m currently a paying subscriber. Too bad to see the application go. But, why? The same happened to Spend Stack <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/02/14/bye-bye-spend.html">recently</a>.</p>
<p>What’s going on? How many developers invoked paid subscription model as being the only road to sustainability? Does it work or not? Is this the start of a new trend? There is something going on here.</p>
<p>When, as users, invest money and time in using applications or service, the last thing we want is to see our beloved apps go like this. I’m currently heavily investing in Craft (coming from Notion). What if the same happens to Craft?</p>

<p>To help you out and start the thread, I’ll answer to my own poll. The pandemic brought me closer to be what we call “a writer”. I write a lot more. I do put more efforts into each piece. I use more tools to help me. My research goes deeper. I have many pieces in the works, all the time. I spend around 5-10 hours for writing each week.</p>
<p>Now, why do I write more? Because there is less noise in my life in general, thanks to the restrictions (no travels, curfew, work from home: no commute). This “silence” created a pool of free time. My creativity took over. So, I write. And I love it.</p>

<p>Today, I tested <strong>HEY World</strong>. This is my non-review. It could have worked great, but it’s not ready yet. One could say “Nice try, buddy”.</p>
<p>I love their response to my test message. One thing stands out from their response, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For now, HEY World is just an experiment. …</p>
<p>“Assuming there’s demand, we’ll begin opening it up for more people soon. And then, hopefully, for all HEY for You customers. <strong>Personal blogs will finally be as easy as sending an email</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that they are on the fence. They already have their tag line. They keep the door wide open. Could it be closer than we think or want to say it?</p>
<p>Now, what I’d like to see is how many emails like mine they get each day and what are they saying?</p>
<p>If they actually turn the switch on, count me in. I’ll find a use of it. For sure.</p>

<p>After reading “<a href="https://tablethabit.com/archive/ghost-on-the-ipad-a-review/">Ghost on the iPad, a Review”</a> from <strong><em>Tablet Habit</em></strong>, I tried to remember my experience when <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/05/09/my-ghost-experiment/">I tried the service myself</a>. It wasn’t a good one for the thing I wanted to do with it: create a photography-oriented blog.</p>
<p>In recent days, it seems that the “<strong>Ghost</strong>” name is gaining traction in the blogging arena. I have to wonder if Ghost is better at this than what I experienced for photography. I don’t think I’ll try it again, but I think they do have one killer feature that other platforms don’t have: the combination of a blogging platform and a newsletter publishing tool. They really look to be well integrated.</p>
<p>One could argue that the difference between blogging or sending a newsletter is small (Think of <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e">HEY, World</a>). I could easily agree. But sometimes, the actual implementation of the integration between those two features can make a real difference.</p>
<p>I’m currently using <strong>Substack</strong> for my monthly newsletter (<a href="https://numericcitizen.substack.com">Numeric Citizen Introspection Newsletter</a>) and WordPress as well as Micro.blog more my blogging needs. Sometimes, I do wish there would be less friction when I’m publishing my work. A single platform doing all of this in a basic manner would be certainly very enticing.</p>

<p>How many websites a blogger can have? Good question. I do have (too?) <a href="https://linktr.ee/numericcitizen">many</a>, each filling their own niche. On that subject, something caught my attention yesterday in the public announcement of <strong>HEY’s experiment</strong>: “<a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e">Hello, World!</a>”. Jason Fried explaining why he never had a blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It was primarily because setting up a personal blog was just too much of a hassle. It felt formal, it required yet another tool, yet another place to write, yet another platform to pay for just one feature. I had to pick a template, I had to think up a name, I had to make the relationship official.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, setting up a blog can be a hassle. For me, it is some kind of challenge and an exercise in creativity. <strong><em>This brings me to something I want to share with you.</em></strong> I’ve been working on something new in the last few days. I’m very excited about it. I started a “<strong><em>metablog</em></strong>”. Yes, another place to publish content. What is it? Well, it is a blog about blogging.</p>
<p>Let’s see what Wikipedia has to say about the word “<strong><em>meta</em></strong>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any subject can be said to have a metatheory, a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its foundations, methods, form and utility, on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a metalanguage, language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do I feel the need to create yet another numeric space? Well, I believe in focused channels in general. I wanted a dedicated space for writing about being a blogger, using tools and services to put things together and out to the world. In other words, it is more about the “how” than anything else. I believe people like to get a look behind the curtain. I certainly do. So, I created this space where I’ll post my updates to <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/30/my-updated-blogger-workflow-as-of-2021-01/">my blogger workflow</a>, in more detail.</p>
<p>So, there you have it: <strong><a href="https://numericcitizen.io">Numeric Citizen I/O</a></strong>. You’ll be able to comment on each individual post (I’m using Commento, a privacy-friendly commenting service.). I dearly encourage you to engage in discussion, ask questions or leave your comments.

<p>Each day, it seems there is always something new happening in the world of newsletters. When it’s not someone famous who joins Substack, a company out of nowhere offers a brilliant idea built around supporting newsletters in one way or the other. I’m thinking of Hey in particular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Email is the internet&rsquo;s oldest instant self-publishing platform. Except you have to define a small audience every time you write. But what if you didn&rsquo;t? What if you could just email the web to reach the world? Introducing the HEY World experiment” - Jason Fried from HEY</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, the company behind the popular HEY email client tentatively announced a new service for their customers. The idea behind is to allow any HEY users to create newsletters and publish them just by sending them to <a href="mailto:world@hey.com">world@hey.com</a>. The service would then post these newsletters on the web, complete with the author’s name. A simple static page, no tracking, no nothing more. I call this: simply brilliant.</p>
<p>The service is not currently available, only in some form of alpha-stage for internal use only. They announced it to read the room and see if there is some interest in something like this that could become some soft of hyper-distributed publishing platform.</p>
<p>I’m personally interested in this kind of service simply because it removes friction in the publishing process. What could be simpler than just writing the newsletter like we do with emails and then hit “send”!? Simply brilliant. For the reader, they can subscribe by email or by using the available RSS feed.</p>
<p>You can read the announcement <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e">here</a>. I like the simplicity of this implementation. Very clean. Very lean. I’m in love. Too bad this isn’t available — yet.</p>

<p>9to5Mac <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/22/should-you-buy-ipad-air-or-ipad-pro/">published</a> a nice comparison between the iPad Air and the 2020 iPad Pro. The latter still hold the crown with its 120Hz ProMotion display and LiDAR. Rumours are pointing to an update for the Pro line in March. The question that comes to my mind is: <strong>what’s missing from the iPad Pro, from the hardware point of view?</strong> I mean, speed, screen, form factor are just close to “perfect”. The main challenge for the iPad line is on the software side. To me, iPadOS 15 and Apple willingness to cross boundaries can’t come soon enough. Better multitasking and external screen support would really help fix long standing issues with the iPad.</p>

<p>My go-to email client got an update today. <strong>Hey</strong> version 1.2 brings a few tweaks in the compose mode. In recent weeks, updates are more frequent as they finally delivered support for corporate email. Now, the other thing I’d like to see is a collapsible view in the feed view. I don’t see how pinch-to-zoom can be added without implementing the opposite to bring a collapsed view.</p>

<p>In the last few months, on Twitter and on Micro.blog, I’ve been witnessing something that takes the shape of a small phenomenon: <strong>people are moving from one place to another in the digital space.</strong> Many are writing about their experience of moving from one hosting site to another. Some are leaving WordPress to return to Ghost. Others are proudly putting together their hosting solutions. The same happens in the newsletters hosting space: people are leaving Mailchimp to go to Substack or Revue. People are looking to get better return on their investment both in time and money. Others are simply trying to optimize their blogging workflow. There is a myriad of reasons why people decide to leave a place for another one.</p>
<p>I find these numeric movements quite fascinating. Are you one of those guys?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/0cff8ddb96.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So I started another experiment involving <strong>Blot.im</strong>. For those who don’t know Blot.im, it is a static web site generator that seems popular among the crowd here. On paper, the process of publishing is very simple: you drag and drop files on a specific folder on your computer and they get instantly published on the web. Sound great, right? That’s what I thought.</p>
<p>My goal with Blot.im is to do some “meta blogging”; a place where I could write about the tools, services and my blogger workflow. So I registered a new domain with GoDaddy: <strong>numericcitizen.io</strong>. Then, I opened my Blot.im account and stated experimenting. The initial setup is pretty simple. And then challenges pretty quickly started to emerge.</p>
<p>First, I wanted my new domain to point my Blot.im domain. Tried to follow the Blot.im <a href="https://blot.im/how/configure/domain">instructions</a> to make it work but all attempts failed. GoDaddy doesn’t support ALIAS DNS records as Blot.im ask me to create. I asked for help from Blot.im support. Still a work in progress.</p>
<p>Second, I chose to use Git as the “client” to push content on the service because I don’t want to use Dropbox, a service I despise. By using Git, I need a Git client on my Mac. I’m tentatively settled on Nova. So far so good. After cloning the Git repo from Blot.im to my local machine, I can then use Ulysses to write my posts and push them with Nova. The workflow is very geeky: create .MD file in Ulysses, “commit” within Nova then hit “push” to publish. Not as seamless as I would like. But here another issue: inserting images with a Markdown file is not as easy as it seems. Again, trying to figure out instructions on Blot.im site doesn’t work. The other thing is that if you drop an image within a folder, it will trigger Blot.im to create its own blog post, something that I don’t want. Not cool. Again, I’m asking support to help me here with this supposedly trivial task.</p>
<p>Third, I would like to use <strong>Github</strong> as the source of truth. Setting up a new repo is simple and cloning it to my local machine too. But, now, how do I make Blot.im to use the Github repo as the source of content? Again, trying to figure out Blot.im <a href="https://blot.im/how/clients/git">instructions</a> but failing to make it work. Still trying to figure that out.</p>
<p>Fourth, tweaking the visual appearance is not as easy as I would have liked. There is a theme editor and I still need to be pretty knowledgeable in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. I did fork one of the theme to make it mine and started to do some tweak but it is a painful trial-and-error process.</p>
<p>All in all, I’m far from positive about Blot.im right now. I spent way too much time on these issues. I’m not sure where this is all going. If you are using Blot.im, please, do me a favour and chime in!</p>

<p>I’m in love with Micro.blog. It’s simple, not too busy. Based on open web standards. But today, I’m a bit frustrated with the bad sad of being too simple. My most important grievance is the lack of design flexibility. Built-in themes are too basics and unappealing. You have to be a HTML and CSS expert to try to figure out how to make simple tweaks. This frustration is behind my recent desire to look elsewhere for hosting the whole thing. I’m willing to invest quite a bit of my time to gin control of the appearance of my online presence. I’m patient. The guys behind Micro.blog are working on the next features and I hope they will address some of my complaints.</p>

<p>It all started with the idea of tweaking my <strong>micro.blog</strong> visual theme. I don’t like it, but this is the best that I could find from the included themes. After reading for a while and seeing people writing about their blogger workflow, I found out that Micro.blog is using <strong>Hugo</strong>, a static website generator. Then I started to learn about Hugo by searching for introduction videos on YouTube. Then, I learned about Hugo themes and how they are constructed, and at the center of how a website is displayed. Since static websites need a place to be stored, <strong>GIT</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> came into the picture. So, I started to read about GIT and Github. Git and Hugo both can be installed on my Mac mini to locally create content and generate a microblog from that. It a great experimentation place to learn and dig a bit deeper. Github is also a place to find new Hugo-based visual <strong>themes</strong>. Then I learned that I can import one of those themes on my machine so can change the visual appearance of my local Hugo microblog. Then, came the idea of publishing this content on the web, on Github, for free. To close the loop, services are available to take Github content and generate a <strong>static website</strong>, again using Hugo, behind a domain name of my choice. Then came the question: why do I need Microblog then? I could own the whole widget! It’s not that simple.</p>
<p>All this because I’m not satisfied with my current Micro.blog visual appearance. The next step is to dig within Micro.blog custom templates and see how I can update them. I’ll have to refresh my memory about <strong>HTML</strong> and learn a bit of <strong>CSS</strong>. The latter seems a bit an arid subject. Oh well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weinbach claims that the always-on display will look like a &ldquo;toned down Lock screen,&rdquo; where the clock and battery charge are always visible, and past notifications are shown through &ldquo;a bar and icons.&rdquo; When users receive a notification, the notification will &ldquo;pop up normally except that the screen will not entirely light up.&rdquo; Instead, &ldquo;it will display it just like you&rsquo;re used to right now, except dimmed down and only temporarily,&rdquo; according to the leaker.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An always-on display is on top of my wish list. How would Apple take advantage of this, at iOS level, is more interesting. Then comes the return of the Touch-ID. I would love to see go in the power button. A smaller notch? What notch?</p>
<p>As shown above, 9to5Mac ran a poll where more than 7000 people chose what feature are the most interesting to them. The return of Touch ID was #1 request at the time of casting my vote. Does COVID-19 have something to do with it?</p>
<p>Last year I skipped iPhone 12. This year, with iPhone 13, things could be different.</p>

<p>Here are two simple but very useful tricks using an iPhone with a <strong>U1 chip</strong>, <strong>iOS 14.4</strong> and an <strong>HomePod mini</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Trick #1</strong>: set a timer with Siri on your HomePod mini to, let’s say, 10 minutes. Then, bring your iPhone close to the HomePod mini, the iPhone will show how much time is left on the timer (make sure the iPhone screen is on).</p>
<p><strong>Trick #2</strong>: let’s say music is playing on your HomePod mini, and that you want to, silently, see what’s playing. Again, bring your iPhone close to the HomePod mini, the iPhone will show the currently playing title.</p>
<p>What a great example of: the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts. This is Apple at it’s best.</p>

<p>It is a bit of a sad day: I decided to delete the excellent expense tracking app <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spend-stack-budget-tracker/id1329068268" title="Spend Stack App Store URL">Spend Stack</a></strong> from my devices and revert to using a simple Numbers spreadsheet to track my subscriptions. Why did I delete this app?</p>
<p>First, the developer <a href="https://www.swiftjectivec.com/a-new-home-for-spend-stack/" title="Spend Stack finds a new owner">sold the app to somebody else</a>. Since last September, no more updates. Second, there is no clear roadmap announcements by the new owner. Nothing. I can’t rely on ephemeral applications even for simple things.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is something that happens all the time these days. Some developers are building great stuff but on the wrong business model. Others are just finding new priorities in their life which have side effects on their personal development projects.</p>
<p>I’m back to Apple’s Numbers and a simple spreadsheet. Sometimes, the best is still in the most basic form and function.</p>

<p>Yes, the title says it all: <strong>I’m looking for new friends to follow on Micro.blog</strong>. After <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/" title="My Twitter Cleanup for a renewed experience">my big Twitter cleanup</a>, the noise in my numeric life has dramatically decreased. I feel zen and I think this is what Micro.blog is all about: a zen place to meet virtual friends sharing the same passions.</p>
<p>So, I’m looking for friend suggestions. Let’s call this “<em><strong>the community-fed referrals day!</strong></em>”. To help you make such referrals, please do remember about my passions: <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>photography</strong>, <strong>privacy protection</strong> and <strong>climate change</strong>.</p>
<p>This brings me to something that I’d like to see improved about Micro.blog: discoverability. When looking to discover new people to follow, we do see a posts count on each user profile, but we don’t know « how recent » the last post is. We know about stale accounts on Twitter, I don’t want to follow stale accounts here. Next, I’d like to see some kind of « behind the scene » analysis of how someone could be interesting for me. I do understand that this is entering a dangerous territory of « algorithm fed reality ». I guess it is har to strike a balance in that respect. Finally, the categories are lacking a bit of breath. Where is “Tech” or “Privacy” or “Climate”?</p>
<p>So, I’m waiting for your referrals. Thanks for taking some of your time to do so. 🙂</p>

Since I’ve completed my Twitter experience transformation as <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/">fully documented here</a>, I barely open Twitter once a day.

<p>I don’t get the idea of <a href="https://aderosa.myportfolio.com/apple-view">such product</a>. The audience for this seems to be too small for Apple.

<p>I think Apple’s interests has much more potential in augmented reality products, services or features. Their work is already bearing fruit with AirPods spatial audio and transparency mode. These are much more appealing to the mass than a VR headset.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Maps</strong> is so much better than it was when it first launched back in 2012. It’s my go-to apps when in comes to finding my way. I never use <strong>Google Maps</strong>. Over the years, Apple upped its game. Recently, <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/12/12/detailed-apple-maps.html">Apple added the detailed mapping and the look around feature for Canada</a>, and it made such a big difference. But how much different? Well, look no further than <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/look-around">Justino Beirne’s latest essay: “WHY DOESN’T “LOOK AROUND” COVER MORE AREAS?”</a>. It is a massive piece of work detailing Apple’s every advances regarding its mapping efforts. I wonder if anyone at Apple ever looked at his work. It’s just mind blowing how much details and analysis goes into this essay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I asked, I’m giving, and I am still blogging — now more than ever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strangely, pure coincidence I guess, I wrote this last week-end “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/02/06/the-journey-is-the-reward/">The journey is the Reward</a>” in which I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It doesn’t really matter if nobody comes and reads my stuff here or there. What matters is the process and the thinking that took place behind my writing. It’s all the small moments where I had to pause, think, read, learn and write. It’s about feeling creative. Alive. The rest is just another tiny drop in the numeric ocean. A few will taste it, and most won’t. That’s the life of a blogger and a writer in a sea of abundance. So, I’ll keep doing it, no matter what.”</p>

<p>The journey is really the reward for me.</p>

<p>I think Intel could have done better than <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-fires-back-at-apple-m1-processors-with-benchmarks">this</a> in a world without the M1 chip. But the problem is that the M1 chip is among us. Obviously, the carefully selected benchmarks results are published to people who doesn’t know about Apple. It’s an issue of perception manipulation. Apple is only getting started. Intel is freaking out and look desperate. 2021 will make matters even worse.</p>
<p>Another one with a look of desperation: Facebook because of iOS 14.4 tracking exposure to the users.</p>

<p>Matt Birchler is writing <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/another-god-damned-ipad-post/">yet another post about the iPad</a>. The last paragraph (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We live in a world where we’re surrounded by computers. People have a home computer, a work computer, a phone, a watch, a smart TV, and smart speakers. Hell, even the iPad’s harshest critics often have one that they use for watching video and playing games. <strong>The iPad is the only device in that list that some people mandate has feature parity with another item on that list</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is so true. I never thought about it this way. Why do we need to constantly compare the iPad to other computing devices to find its legitimacy? For me, the iPad is one of the best computing device of all time. There is nothing like it, it is singular.</p>

<p>According to a recent <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/05/state-of-apple-silicon---half-of-the-most-popular-mac-apps-still-need-rosetta">small survey by AppleInsider</a>, 53% of apps are running natively on <strong>M1-powered Macs</strong>. What about the remaining 47%? Well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Without native support, they&rsquo;re run in Rosetta 2 emulation. That may conceivably turn out to mean that they run faster than they did on old Intel hardware, but it&rsquo;s not why you&rsquo;ve bought an Apple Silicon Mac.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the problem is that <strong>Apple’s Rosetta 2</strong> is too good at running non-native apps. It’s so good that they can run faster than on an Intel-powered Mac.</p>
<p>A lot of things are on developer’s shoulders. There are enthusiastic developers and then there are the lazy one. The former rush to add M1 support for their apps even if the performance gain is negligible. The latter either doesn’t care, think it’s good enough or they don’t have full control of the software stack they use to build their apps. Think about the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/blog/apple-silicon">Electron framework</a>. It does support the M1-powered Macs. Developers need to upgrade their apps to take advantage of the latest Apple technologies. An example if the email client for HEY. The last update came in September of last year.</p>
<p>As someone who use both, native and non-native apps, on my M1-powered Mac mini, I don’t see much difference, <em>most of the time</em>. Apps like Lightroom CC or Pixelmator Pro do show a big improvement in many operations. But for the rest? Again, Rosetta 2 is doing a marvellous job and the whole experience on Big Sur with M1 is really good.</p>

<p>It’s becoming quite frustrating to see Apple’s Safari not being supported for <strong>browser extensions</strong>. Safari is now reportedly supporting standard web extensions but with an Apple twist making it cumbersome for developers to add support. Apple being Apple, I think it is related to the requirement of having to download an application in order to be able to expose an extension to Safari’s engine. Thanks to privacy protection, Apple is forcing the game here, but this has real consequences.</p>

<p>I like to see other people talk about their own writing or blogging workflows. Here’s an <a href="https://gr36.com/shortcut-publishing-to-wordpress/">interesting tidbit from Greg Morris</a> about using Apple’s Shortcut to publish to WordPress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Shortcuts is a really robust way to publish to WordPress and not have to use the WordPress app or third-party app.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple’s Shortcuts are also an important part of my blogger workflow. Since I’m using Ulysses, which supports publishing directly to WordPress, I don’t need a shortcut for that. But for many other small things, it is a valuable tool in my arsenal. Shortcuts are an interesting technology within the iOS and iPadOS ecosystem.</p>

<p>From John Gruber’s Apple report card:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I’m reminded of all the UI and interaction designs and changes in iOS and MacOS that are just bad. There’s a real sense that <strong>_ Apple’s current HI team, under Alan Dye, is a “design is what it looks like” group, not a “design is how it works” group_</strong>. Exhibit A: What MacOS 11 Big Sur has done to document proxy icons. Arguably it looks better to hide them. (I disagree, but I can see the counterargument.) Inarguably, they work far worse now — harder to use for people who use them, and much harder to discover for people who don’t yet know about them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gruber often has an effective way of putting out his take on Apple’s issues. If you look and use macOS Big Sur for a while, you should get a feel that only the visual parts were redesigned, not the way it works in response to the user behaviour. Big difference.</p>

<p>This morning I got the most recent update to the venerable photo sharing service: <strong>Flickr</strong>. The only addition to this update, <strong>support for iOS 14 widgets</strong>. Finally! It’s quite a change from the usual “Bug fixes and improvements.”. Even if I’m no longer actively using Flickr, I was happy to see that widgets were finally supported. So, I frantically updated the apps to have a look at the possibilities. What a let down. Sure, all three sizes are supported, but we cannot change any widget settings! How about being able to set the source for pictures or even stats or anything! Nope. I call this pathetic.</p>
<p>No wonder why I left Flickr and services like Unsplash took over the world. Over the years and during its tumultuous history, Flickr was a series of promises left without real and deep actions to transform the platform. They brag about having two million groups. It takes just a few minutes to see that a vast majority of these groups are ghost towns. And don’t get me started with the general design of the app and the website.</p>

What I found is a super nicely designed page with highlights of Apple’s ecosystem privacy focused features. <strong><em>To me, Apple’s privacy stance is a product, not a feature.</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Privacy is a fundamental human right. At Apple, it’s also one of our core values. Your devices are important to so many parts of your life. What you share from those experiences, and who you share it with, should be up to you. We design Apple products to protect your privacy and give you control over your information. It’s not always easy. But that’s the kind of innovation we believe in.” — Apple</p>

<p>Apple made mandatory privacy protection “nutrition” labels on its App Store. One guy refuses to update its apps since then: <strong>Google</strong>. Maybe they are even worst than Facebook if such a thing is even possible. Was Google caught by surprise? Highly impossible. They had many months to prepare for that. When your business model highly depends on sucking all users data, it’s hard to escape suspicion.</p>

<p>Really nice update (and unexpected) to my preferred Twitter client. <a href="https://twitter.com/tapbots/status/1354150774247464963">Tweetbot version 6</a> received a refreshed design, full support for Twitter APIs v2 and cleans up unsupported features with latest APIs. <strong>Tweetbot</strong> startup is much faster than Twitter’s client and exposes a few features that aren’t available otherwise. Design-wise, Tweetbot contains a lot of nice touches throughout the app. Compared to that, Twitter’s own client feels uninspired.</p>
<p>Like a growing number of apps recently introduced or updated, Tweetbot 6 now is subscription-based. I expect a few angry users but I’m not one of them. I find the pricing quite reasonable. I chose to go with the yearly subscription at 50% price reduction, a no brainer to me.</p>
<p>Tweetbot has recently returned as my go to Twitter client during <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/">my recent Twitter reset</a> and I’m very happy with it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Someone stoled my most recent article</em></strong>. I hate when this happens. I guess my article was good enough for this guy to bother.</p>
<p>This morning, I got a pingback on WordPress for an article being published elsewhere as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ac6224c149.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Someone copied my latest article “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/">The Ultimate Twitter Tips and Tricks for Mastering Your Twitter Experience</a>”. By doing so, he forgot to remove one of the URL pointing back to another previously published article, “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/04/07/my-review-of-mailbrew-a-powerful-and-time-saving-internet-information-aggregator/">My Review of Mailbrew: a Powerful and Time-Saving Internet Information Aggregator</a>”, I was notified via a pingback. I paid a visit to the “publisher” and sure enough, 90% of my article was reproduced. The guy removed the screenshots but left the captions (weird). The title was modified too. The conclusion was removed. Here is what I wrote to the “published”:</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/88bf88df4e.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I also posted the same thing on the comment section but comments being moderate, I don’t think the guy will republish them. I will see what happens. This is the second time this happens to me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong><em>The Startup magazine</em></strong> on Medium accepted my article submission. More than 750K followers can see it from the magazine homepage. 😃</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/1/17/speech-and-publishing">recent article</a> by Benedict Evans exposes how hard it is to “fix” social networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The internet and then social platforms break a lot of our definitions of different kinds of speech, and yet somehow Facebook / Google / Twitter are supposed to recreate that whole 200-year tapestry of implicit structures and consensus, and answer all of those questions, from office parks in the San Francisco Bay Area, for both the USA and Myanmar, right now. We want them to Fix It, but we don&rsquo;t actually know what that means.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often think about issues that platforms like Facebook brings to our society. I don’t pretend to have any solution. I can’t quite define what Facebook is actually from a societal point of view. That being said, a lack of definition and understanding cannot prevent me to wish for things to be done differently. And I have one simple wish.</p>
<p><strong><em>I want the eradication of algorithm-based feeds</em></strong>. I want them to be regulated, prohibited even. At the very least, it should be an opt-in “feature”. I want the return of chronological feeds. No tweaks, no tricks, nothing more. Nothing less. I want all people to have a look at the same reality. Two people having the exact same followers and following the same guys should give the same timeline. Period.</p>
<p>Without hyper-manipulated feeds, we have to wonder about the usefulness of all gathered data about us and our behaviours. Maybe ads targeting doesn’t make as much sense in tact hypothetical context.</p>
<p>If two people don’t see the same thing, it’s because the choice was made by an individual wishing to control his or her exposure, not by a corporation’s algorithm or an arbitrary group of people.</p>
<p>That’s my wish. Let’s try it and see if things change for the better.</p>

<p>In “<a href="https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/a-love-letter-to-the-link-post">A Love Letter to the Link Post</a>”, CJ Chilvers lament the lost of <strong>link posts</strong> from the blogosphere. Link posts marked the debut of so many websites raison d’être back in the nineties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At that time, they weren’t even called blogs. You’d simply update the front page of your website every day with a few interesting links you discovered since the day before.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love link posts. I follow many bloggers just to have a peek at their discoveries and comments about them. A big portion of my monthly <a href="https://numericcitizen.substack.com">Numeric Citizen Introspection newsletter</a> is built around sharing a curated content of links that I find interesting. They generally fit within the boundaries of my deep interests. Link posts within newsletters = 🥰</p>

This is not a trivial thing, generally speaking. In that particular case, it was an exercise of extreme frustration all along. If you did watch this YouTube video, this is me, the expert. So spot on.

<p>What a pleasant surprise today: a big update to <strong>Craft</strong> was released. Version 1.2.2 brings a lot of <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/gy6m6pUAYiCxqA">improvements</a> on the table. This release should have been numbered version 1.3, not 1.2.2! All platforms (iPad and macOS) received attention and improvements. One of the most important thing for me being the addition of direct export to <strong>Ulysses</strong>, <strong>DayOne</strong>, <strong>OmniFocus</strong> among others. We could already export in TextBundle or PDF and Word but these exports options, I feel my data can freely move out of the platform. My blogger workflow is simplified.</p>
<p>I’m still working on my review of Craft by the way. It takes longer than I would have liked. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Bye bye dear <strong>TouchBar</strong>. Hello <strong>MagSafe</strong> power connector. Here’s some more ports. Rumours are pointing toward the same thing. Apple will revert many of its controversial decision of the last five years. Many will be pleased. Function is winning over form. I think Apple is following the trend they started with the 2019 Mac Pro which essentially erasing five years of non sense with the 2013 Mac Pro. Apple is fully back to the Mac. And down on earth, with all of us.</p>
<p><em>Clearly, actual creatives and professionals disagree with Apple’s soul-searching because if all of these rumors come to fruition, Apple will be returning to what was already considered the MacBook Pro’s zenith.

			 <p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/701c4138a2.png" alt="A different way to wear the Apple Watch"></p>
<p>Since getting my <strong>Apple Series 6</strong> last fall (see my review <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/03/upgrading-from-an-apple-watch-series-4-to-series-6/">here</a>), my <strong>heart readings</strong> aren’t working as expected. I’m not alone who is experiencing this problem (just google it!). During a workout, heartbeats readings are not available for the first 5 to 10 minutes into the workout. On a 30-minute workout, it can make a big difference.</p>
<p>I think I found a way to greatly improve the heartbeats readings. Simply by wearing my Apple Watch as shown on the picture above. I must say that it is not perfect. As shown below, I do get a few minutes of lost readings, though, but not as much as before. The problem could be related to the presence on some fur on my front arm. Also, always making sure the Apple Watch band is tied close enough to the wrist is a must.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/99df752207.png" alt="A few minutes of lost heartbeat readings"></p>
<p>Are you experiencing the same issue? Let me know if you permanently fixed it.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a quote from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger (as reported by <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/01/intel-will-wait-for-new-ceo-to-make-critical-decisions-on-manufacturing-crisis.html">The Oregonian</a>)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We have to deliver better products to the PC ecosystem than any possible thing that a lifestyle company in Cupertino. We have to be that good, in the future.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The fundamental problem with Intel is that they will never make the whole widget (the products) like Apple does. That&rsquo;s the key for insanely great products. Intel&rsquo;s CPU are small enablers at best. <strong>The vertical integration of the whole stack (hardware, OS, apps, services) makes what Apple is all about.</strong> There is no way for Intel to emulate that by cooperating with hundreds of OEMs.</p>
<p>Sorry, Pat, nice try.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1349607105112776704?s=21">DHH on Twitter</a> seems happy that the messaging app, <strong>Signal</strong>, finally has its moment. I don’t really know about Signal, but I do know about another one, <strong>Telegram</strong>. Now that <strong>Parler</strong> is out of this world, I’m wondering if people prefer Signal over Telegram. Is Signal more secure than Telegram? According to <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-encrypted-messaging-apps/telegram/">this website</a>, Telegram, is apparently not as secure as its maker pretends it is.</p>
<p>Now, I’m wonder how these movements between messaging platforms would be affected if Apple decided to make <strong>iMessage</strong> cross-platform: on iOS, on macOS, on the web and on Android. Maybe this year the dynamic is different enough for Apple to make the move? Are they afraid that people will leave the iPhone if iMessage is available on Android? What is more sticky for the Apple ecosystem: the Music app or iMessage? In my opinion, iMessage is much more powerful than Music for keeping people inside Apple’s walled garden.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/">latest report from MacRumors</a> about <strong>Apple’s upcoming MacBook Pro redesign</strong> is quite interesting and intriguing.</p>
<p>First, the removal of the TouchBar and the return of the MagSafe technology is utterly surprising. If this is the case, Apple would be undoing five years of design decisions. A side effect of the TouchBar removal would be a more competitive pricing of the MacBook Pro line.</p>
<p>Second, the rumour about Apple opting for an all-out flat edge design makes me think the new MacBook Pro would be similar to two iPad Pro linked together with a hinge. Obviously, the screen parts would be thinner than the lower body of the MacBook Pro. Intriguing.</p>
<p>Now, if these rumours materialize, to me, it would mean that the current 13” MacBook Pro would be no longer necessary with a 14” model in its place. If that’s the case, the 13” MacBook Pro was only a transition and temporary move from Apple.</p>
<p>We are at the beginning of another exciting year for Apple.</p>

<p><strong>Mailbrew received a big update this week</strong>. The change log is pretty extensive. The most important change is that the home page and the whole user experience for that matter is now more about reading your digests than the brews edit view. I like this change a lot. Digests are presented in the order they were received. You can go from one issue to another easily for a specific brew. You can also select a specific brew to see associated digests. The reading experience is better overall compared to HEY’s Feed view. The only missing thing is a “save clip” option.</p>
<p>Beside links to external content, within a digest, when it is appropriate, there is a button for entering a reader view. In this view, a minimalist browser will let the reader immerse himself to limit distractions. It reminds me of the Safari reader view. There is always the save button available to put aside an article in case you don’t have time to read it at the moment. Mailbrew provides a separate list for those saved items.</p>
<p>There are a ton of other small change and improvements. Sharing our brews is easier. Sharing a digest also is closer at hand. All in all, this is a solid update to an already excellent service. You can read my initial review of Mailbrew <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/04/07/my-review-of-mailbrew-a-powerful-and-time-saving-internet-information-aggregator/">here</a>.

I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this feature for a long time.

On the Mac, the same sequence applies, rendering MarsEdit unnecessary. How cool is that? Optimizing my workflow is very satisfying. 😎👨🏻‍💻</p>

<p>What does it take to be a hood programmer? Or better yet, what does it take to like programming hence writing or reading algorithms? Math? Language? Arts? A combination? When I started in computer science at the University, my friends thought that I was good at maths. It wasn&rsquo;t the case. Before deciding which field I would like to study, I was afraid of computer science, thinking myself that we had to be really good with mathematics. My experience shows that it is not the case. I&rsquo;m average at maths but good at programming and in computer science in general. Is it surprising? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->According to this article<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, no. In fact, computer programming isn&rsquo;t the same thing as doing maths from a brain activity perspective. It is more like something very demanding where a totally different part of the brain is solicited. Fascinating. It may (or may not) explain why you can be good in computer science but not as good in mathematics. Who knows.</p>
<p>By having a better understanding of what parts of the brain are solicited, we may find common ground with other disciplines. It is really hard to attract people in computer science and knowing what it takes from a brain perspective could help direct efforts of recruiting the right people who will like to read and write algorythms but are not good at maths!</p>

<p>Thirteen years already. Gosh, time flies. Steve Jobs announces the iPhone. One of his best presentation. I remember it so well. At that time, I was a huge user (and fan) of the Blackberry. After using a RIM two-way pager for a while, I upgraded to Blackberry with a bigger screen with a monochrome display. But, with the iPhone, I knew, deep within me, this would be a real game-changer. My feelings were the same as with the launch of the Macintosh. What I didn&rsquo;t know, though, was how profound and long-lasting the iPhone-effect would be on the rest of the tech world. We still feel its effect these days. I had to wait until the iPhone 3GS, in 2009, to get my hands on one for my personal use. I was still using a Blackberry for the office. Yep, I had two smartphones with me all the time.</p>

<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his predictions for iPad in 2021<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPadInsight<!-- raw HTML omitted --> puts multi-user support on top of its list for iPadOS 15 without mentionning a real use case beyond the obvious. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Do we ask multi-user support on iPad because it is something we take for granted on &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; computers? Or is because there is a real use case for that feature, beyond the classroom or the conference room? Does the multi-user support solve the problem of your friend borrowing your iPad while keeping him or her from seeing your stuff?</p>
<p>Enabling multi-user support on the iPad has profound implications. How would the instant-on, instant-use experience be impacted by having multi-user enabled? Is the security enclave capable of holding more than one user FaceID? How iCloud Drive data be handled if users both have their data in icloud, the same way as on macOS? What about apps collections being different from one user to the other, how the iPad homescreen change upon logoff-logon? How fast? What kind of pressure does this feature put on the iPad system memory? Would this feature enabled on the Pro line only?</p>
<p>For me, the iPad is a personal device, just like the iPhone. Apple likes it this way, for their bottom line. That&rsquo;s my guess.</p>

<p>If only Microsoft could finish the job started with Windows 7. Windows 10 user interface is a bunch of previously used visual elements that Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t care to clean up. For example, consider the computer settings area. On the surface, the iconography speaks the recent visual langague defined by Microsoft. But, as you try to go deeper to change a less frequently used setting, you&rsquo;re back to a pre-Windows 10 era. I don&rsquo;t believe Microsoft will do this &ldquo;major&rdquo; refresh as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->recently reported by Windows Central<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, not in a way they refused to do in the last ten years, anyway.</p>
<p>As a side note, colour me Apple fanboy if you want, but many pundits will grumble when Apple is actually refreshing the user interface like they did with macOS Big Sur (or iOS 7, remember?). At least, it is either consistently clean or consistently ugly, depending of your aestheticism tastes. You won&rsquo;t as easily find a macOS Yosemite visual asset in macOS Big Sur or even macOS Catalina. Inconsistencies do exist in macOS but they are usually limited to very specific visual tweaks (like to trafic lights placements).</p>

<p>I got this notification in the Wordpress.app this morning. Six years already. Over the years, I became a paying subcriber of their Business plan. Automattic offers great support when you need it. But in the least year or so, I noticed a change in the way they do business with us, paying members. There are a lot of reminders about additional services available to us. which aren&rsquo;t free, by the way. They keep advertising their ExactMetrics service that I don&rsquo;t need with tricks that I don&rsquo;t appreciate as shown in the second screen shot above. Recently, they started to advertise WordPress courses on the main admin page on WordPress.com. I really don&rsquo;t like the trend.

<p>I want to pick from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this blog post from Initial Charge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I remember a small story when the iPad came out in 2010. After a few days of playing with it, I went to the office to show it to a few of my coworkers when I got my iPad. After a few minutes of demonstration, I got two remarks. One was about the lack of a USB port. The second was about the lack of support for Flash-enabled websites. On that one complaint, I remember arguing about the simple fact that moving your mouse cursor around would trigger some flash-based animations like making a button bigger or showing up a menu on many websites. There was no such thing as a “mouseover” event on the iPad, so those websites that were dependant on this would break the interaction experience. At this very moment, I thought Adobe Flash was doomed. More than ten years to get rid of this crasp. That was long.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame in a world where open standards are on the way out. RSS feeds are another important part of Podcasts, another open standard where big tech would like to monetize, i.e. make it proprietary.</p>
<p>Amoroso continues: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The readers who subscribe to your RSS feed always see all of your posts. No matter what Google, Facebook, or Twitter decide.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A long time ago I decided my blogs feeds would push the complete content of the articles. As I don&rsquo;t have ads on my blogs, I don&rsquo;t really care if the readers consume the content from the RSS feed only. RSS feeds are conduits who escape any algorithm-based feeds. It&rsquo;s the most direct connexion between a blogger and their readers.</p>
<p>For the best part, Amaroso nails it: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->They are the readers you want. The superfans who share your work. They may be bloggers themselves and link to your posts from theirs, or enable other opportunities such as guest blogging or podcast interviews. Those few RSS subscribers are much more engaged and valuable than the many who don&rsquo;t even click links on social media.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If you know how to use RSS, you&rsquo;re my best friend, you are more then welcome.</p>

<p>Writing is an important part of my life. It&rsquo;s all about feeling creative, thinking, taking a pause of everything else.

I would say, one percent of my visitors will do it.</p>
<p>For 2021, I decided to set a new goal for myself: stopping by, taking the time to drop a meaningful comment on a blog post or an article from someone else. I call this goal <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->writer engagement<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Some platforms are easier to interact with than others.

<p>The year 2020 came to an end without me posting my personal year in review. You might wonder why. I read many reviews in the last few days. Most of them are delightful to read as they contain gems about personal lessons learned, personal discoveries, etc. To write those reviews, you have to be prepared for that particular intention to write about it later. Without notes, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible and takes too much time to prepare. It also would be too easy to miss essential tidbits.</p>
<p>What about 2021? Good news, for 2021, I want to be ready. Now it&rsquo;s the best time to get organized. All year long, I&rsquo;ll be using the excellent notes taking application called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Craft<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I already started to put things down. The picture at the top of this post is a glimpse at my journaling space structure, where personal notes will be confined all year long.

<p>Two things. First, Apple&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 was and continue to be faultless. Some governments should take notes.

Rightfully, Apple named the Disney+ Apple TV app the best of 2020. Not only Disney knows how to create great movies, they also know how to create great user experience for the Apple TV. Apple should take some notes here. Google, with its crappy YouTube app should just start over. Now the 9$ a month question: will I keep the Disney+ subscription?</p>

<p>In 2020, we started to get a better peek at Apple&rsquo;s labs, at least, this is what Apple wanted us to believe. My question: was this setup a real lab or was it entirely made up?

<p>Every year, a few days before Christmas, I spend some time to create all my own and original Christmas cards for my beloved ones. It’s a pretty simple process involving two different apps. One is Unsplash and the other is Adobe Spark Post. I usually start by browsing Unsplash for finding the right photo for inspiration. Once I settle on one picture, I download it and launch Adobe Spark to create the initial montage. I make sure to reserve some space for the best wishes text. This year, I’ll do things a bit differently as my cards will be digital-only. I’ll send them via iMessage. Some people would prefer to have a printed version, but 2020 being&hellip; well&hellip; 2020, I’ll go ahead with a digital version only.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of Adobe Spark Post. For some reason, I don’t see a lot of noise around it on the web. I use it for many other things than creating Christmas cards, as the picture above can show. You can read <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2019/06/09/my-review-of-adobe-spark-post/">my review of Adobe Spark Post</a> here on my main blog.</p>

<p>Can you believe it, up until today, I was still resisting the installation of any non-native applications on my M1-based Mac mini. I refrained myself from letting in any Rosetta-dependant apps to run. I shouldn&rsquo;t have made a big story about this non-issue, but it&rsquo;s was more psychological than anything else.</p>
<p>The list of non-native apps is small, but it started to negatively affect my ability to complete specific tasks. These apps waiting in line were: SafariMarkdownLinker (Safari Extension), Grammarly (Safari Extension), Adobe Creative Cloud installer (required to install the native version of Lightroom CC), 1Password.</p>
<p>Today, I finally let it go and went ahead with installing these remaining pieces of my application landscape. I feel good, and everything is working just fine, as expected.</p>

<p>Today, unexpectedly and for the first timr, I had a chance to experience <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter&rsquo;s Space<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s a virtual room of twitter users who can speak to each other. When there is an open space, a small icon appear at the top of your timeline among twitter fleets. Tapping on it allows you to enter the space. By default your mic is disabled. You have to request permission first in order to be able to speak. There is a speaker who controls people&rsquo;s requests to speak. People who are listener can react using emojis. It&rsquo;s pretty interesting, much more interesting than audio tweets in fact.</p>
<p>I spent maybe ten minutes chatting with the space owner about things like COVID-19, confinement in Christmas time and how to use Twitter space. Others in the room were just listeners. It was pretty cool. I can see myself using this instead of doing a podcast for example. It&rsquo;s easier to setup up, doesn&rsquo;t require a distribution platform to maintain. I could setup a space to talk about Apple, photography, privacy or climate change. Can&rsquo;t wait to try it out with my followers, once the feature officially rollout.</p>

<p>ProRAW is about extending the possible scenarios where you can take great looking pictures. Just like in traditional photography gear, adding different lenses allow for more possibilities. It&rsquo;s incredible how far iPhone photography has come since 2007. I&rsquo;ll have to wait for fall of 2021 before being able to take advantage of all this as I&rsquo;m not planning to upgrade to the iPhone 12 Pro. If all goes well, I should be able to bring a shinny iPhone 13 (or whatever name they give for next&rsquo;s year iPhone) with me on my next trip to Europe, on October of 2021.</p>

<p>Is this new? I mean the format in which Apple is presenting the current iOS and iPadOS usage? The last time I paid attention to this, Apple was using a pie chart. I prefer this level of details. A few thoughts about these numbers are in order.</p>
<p>First, iPhone users are quicker to update their devices compared to iPad users. Second, Apple makes a clear distinction between devices recently introduced (in the last four years) from the rest. In both categories, the numbers shows that a vast majority of users adopt the latest release of the operating system. Third, even though people keeps their device longer than before, Apple keep supporting older devices (older than four years). All of this helps keeping the adoption rate at very high levels. Kudos to Apple.</p>
<p>These numbers also tell another story: Apple’s shear power over its install base is impressive. Apple has the ability to move it in new directions pretty quickly as users are quick to embrace new features, either by buying new devices or by updating their current ones because they are still supported by Apple. Will 2021 bring a different tone to this story with iOS 15? Maybe, maybe not.</p>

<p>Here is an issue that I ran into yesterday with &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sign in with Apple<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo;. I suspect I&rsquo;m not alone in that situation.</p>
<p>The excellent website building tool, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Universe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, came out with an update that introduces <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sign-in with Apple<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. After updating the application on my iPad, I launch the app. I&rsquo;m welcomed with a sign-in screen. The Sign-in with Apple option is prominently displayed. I tap on it. I&rsquo;m then presented with the typical panel to decide if I expose my real email address and my real name. Now the troubles begin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already a user of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Universe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which email did I use to create my initial account? I can&rsquo;t remember. What if I choose the wrong one? I try one of my email address that I decided to reveal. Hit sign-in; after a few seconds of working progress, I&rsquo;m met with welcome screen for new users. Duh. I&rsquo;m trying to get back, to no avail.</p>
<p>This issue reveals a big flaw in Sign in with Apple: when you are already a user of a service, switching to the more secure sign-in option makes it hard to associate this login to your existing account. I ran into the same issue with most of the services where I tried to make the switch. I suspect this is hindering the adoption of an otherwise secure upgrade to traditional authentication service. Too bad.</p>

<p>Yesterday Apple launched their latest service offering: Fitness+. I gave it a try, and I fell in love. The first step was to update all my supported devices: the iPhone, my Apple Watch and my Apple TV. After spending a few minutes glancing at the different type of workouts, I elected to do a twenty minutes treadmill workout using my iPhone and my AirPods Pro. For this session, Jamie-Ray was my coach. As you can see, I think I made pretty well. I liked everything about the experience, from onboarding to the actual workout session with on-screen feedbacks and the finale. The music choice was good too! After my session, I gave a look at the Apple TV Fitness application. Upon launching the app, you have to select the Apple Watch associated with the person who will interact with the service. One note, if your Apple Watch name is too long, spacing on the screen won’t allow you to easily see which Apple Watch is which; you’ll have to wait so see the text to scroll, it’s a bit of an annoyance. I checked a few workout previews and sure enough, the video quality is exceptional on the Apple TV 4K.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a great start for Fitness+. It’s probably the best example of the whole being larger than the sum of its part. The combination of great devices, great content, great user experience, impeccable execution are the ingredients and enablers for the best experience. Bravo Apple.</p>
<p>Oh, I’ll try to exercise five to six days a week.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m working from home from mi-March of this year, I no longer have to commute. I save countless hours per week just because of this. On top of that, consider many activities on the weekend that no longer can take place because of the on-and-off restrictions in place.</p>
<p>I never wrote or published as much stuff in the last nine months as in the last year or so. I have a lot of projects in my head, small and more significant. I did spend quite a lot as I no longer travelling on software, services, work-from-home equipment. I also have more time for reading than before, it makes a difference.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is transformative at the society level but also a personal level. There are things that I don&rsquo;t want to return when COVID-19 is no longer among us. Time is a precious resource, once you have it, you don&rsquo;t want to mess with it.</p>

<p>In 1990-1991, I was working for an Apple authorized dealer. I remember the Quadra line, in particular, the 700. It was the most popular machine among desktop publisher. It was fast. I liked its vertical and boxy look. It was different. What is interesting is the description of the Motorola 68040 processor. Compare this to the Apple Silicon, it&rsquo;s simply unbelievable. The M1 chip comes from an alien world.</p>

<p>Recently I spent more time than usual on YouTube for different reasons: to look at AirPods Max first impressions, to learn more about Synology DSM 7.0 beta, etc. After a while, it&rsquo;s easy to see a trend that bugs me: design uniformity across the board. See the previous image gathers a few popular YouTubers channel content pages. They all look about the same or at least designed by the same designer. On top of that, there seems to be a trend where the weider you look, the better. When did that trend start?</p>

<p>Published by BasicAppleGuy, a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->short survey of his experience with MacOS Snow Leopard<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, back in 2009. I remember Steve Jobs talking about this release of MacOS as a pause in new features introduction in order to build the foundations for the next decade of MacOS (now spelled macOS).

Their operating systems are muc more complex and feature rich, Apple is not standing still either. I cannot see them doing this.</p>

<p><em>”I hope, now that Apple has a chip architecture that doesn’t get in the way, it ramps up its industrial design … and more importantly, it reads the reviews and iterates more thoughtfully and consistently.”</em></p>
<p>That’s exactly what I’m hoping too. The iMac and the MacBook design in general were highly influenced by the thermal pressure the Intel chip was imposing. The next iMac design revision will certainly take advantage of the Apple Silicon low thermal dissipation and put Apple in a more creative mode when it comes to imagining what a desktop computer should be.</p>

			 <p>As an IT guy, looking at what Synology has in store for 2021 makes me pretty excited. I <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/12/07/massive-update-coming.html">wrote about that yesterday</a> but I took a deeper look at what is coming in DSM 7.0, their NAS operating system. I didn’t pay too much attention to their photo management software that comes with a Synology NAS, but that might change. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/11/28/my-updated-blogger-workflow-as-of-2020-11/">In my blogger workflow</a>, there is something I can optimize is the use of a photo management to store all my screen shots, stock photos, visual assets, etc. Synology Photos could be the tool I was looking for for a long time. I don’t want to use Apple’s Photos application as I don’t really like to see screenshots intermixed with family pictures. If Synology Photos is as solid as it looks, if their mobile application is much improved to their current version, I’ll certainly give it a serious try. On top of that, this photo feature also enable remote access to the photo library. Very interesting.</p>
<p>I’ve been shopping around for a home NAS for a long time and only made the plunge this year. After much thinking and reading, I settled on Synology because I saw a mature company offering mature products with a solid reputation. Again, DSM 7.0 brings a lot of new features and improvements which makes me feel happy about my choice of going with them. Can’t wait to try what’s new.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been using a Synology DS720+ NAS for a few months now and boy do I like it! On my blogger to do list is a review of this device. The breath of features never stop to impress me. I’m a big fan. I use it for archiving, space reclamation on my Mac and much more. It’s fast and reliable as I had a chance to test the repair feature after losing a hard drive (yes, already!). It worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>This week, Synology will make DSM 7.0 available for beta testers, the braves. Looking at <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/beta/DSM70Beta">the announcement web page</a>, it looks like a massive update. Refreshed screens, more cloud integration, admin rights delegation and added feature like Active Insight will certainly be exciting additions. One question: I think Synology is about to add a subscription for this, which I’m not sure I’ll pay for, depending of its usefulness in its final form. We’ll see.</p>

			 <p>See that UI of the iPhone when you receive a call while being on another with someone else? Pretty confusing, right? You stress out to understand what to do while hoping you’ll have enough time to not miss the call. it is a stressful user experience. Why is Apple not giving any attention to this very specific UI is beyond me. They made notable change in iOS 14 with the notification-like interface for incoming calls, which was more than welcomed.</p>
<p>The way I came over this challenge is to concentrate on the icon labels instead of the icon itself. It does help a lot in my case.</p>

We all know 2020 was in fact the entry point for next year&rsquo;s act two of this transition. From what we can read in the article, Apple could make high-end PC obsolete from a RAW power perspective with as many as 32 cores. Does anybody wonder if Intel has good sleep these days?</p>

Using the macOS virtual desktop feature is nice but not always the best solution when working on many different things at once. This is where Apple&rsquo;s Sidecar comes into play. Prior to this, I rarely used Sidecar, but not anymore. I&rsquo;ll use it with the Mac mini or the iMac, depending of the current work session. As a bonus, I get to use a “soft&quot; Touch Bar at the bottom of the display, which is cool because I love the Touch Bar.</p>

			 <p>Over the last two years, I expanded my online presence. Maybe a bit too much; it’s hard to keep up. I came across something interesting recently: <strong>Linktr.ee</strong>. According to their website, the purpose of the service is to  <em>“Connect audiences to all of your content with just one link”</em>. It’s exactly a case of “you don’t know you need it until you see it!”. Building the mini-website is quick and easy. There are enough layout options to make your page look like your own. I opted for the paying tier which enables more design choices and better analytics. Hope you like it and pay a visit to learn the breath of my online presence. I think of it as some form of a modern business card.</p>

Among the changes, a redesigned and simplified controller dashboard with real-time statistics which are really helpful. The device management UI also received a redesign. Some of the previously available information has been removed or moved around. CPU, Memory consumption and internal temperature are higher than before (around +10%-30%), though. Overall, its&rsquo;a solid update. Oh, and it is running an 4 cores ARM processor.</p>

First, I know the M1 Mac mini speed will make <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/12/02/im-already-afraid.html">the iMac seem slow in comparison</a>. That, I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;ll keep my iMac for a while as my gateway to my legacy software and apps for my work. Second, upon the first boot of the Mac mini, I&rsquo;ll set it up as a brand new machine. No Time Machine restore. I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I started fresh on a new Mac. I&rsquo;ll depend on Apple&rsquo;s iCloud to bring back all my stuff on my 1 TB SSD drive. Then, I&rsquo;ll meticulously pick which app will make the cut for installation on this shiny and speedy machine. I&rsquo;m building a <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/11/16/my-growing-list.html">list of universal apps</a> I want to install on it, but I&rsquo;ll also need the help of the excellent website, &ldquo;<a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/">Is Apple Silicon Ready?</a>&rdquo;. Only &ldquo;Universal&rdquo; apps will be allowed on it. Even if Rosetta 2 is a technical marvel, I don&rsquo;t want it to contaminate my Mac. I want the pure M1 Mac experience. Oh, one last thing, if an application’s icon is not good enough, I can search for a better one of places like <a href="https://macosicons.com/">https://macosicons.com/</a> and <a href="https://www.macosicongallery.com/">https://www.macosicongallery.com/</a> or Michael Flarup’s <a href="https://applypixels.com/resource/juice">excellent icons pack</a>.</p>

My timeline is constantly filled with my followers posting fleets. I guess some do like them. I decided to give it a serious try. I think they add another dimension to Twitter that I happen to find interesting for highlighting purposes. It’s simple to use, just enough design flexibility. There are is one drawback: they only show up on the iPhone (not the iPad or the web), which I find strange and somewhat arbitrary.</p>

			 <p>Let&rsquo;s play a game. One of your customer calls you and ask for a meeting (virtual or in person). Before answering this request, you have to look at your calendar to see your free/busy time. It&rsquo;s a time consuming and error prone process. What if your favorite calendaring app could generate a map of your weekly schedule with all sensible information masked out, like in the following example (made with Fantastical). This could be sent as a PDF file to the customer, would save a lot of time. It&rsquo;s surprising that, to my knowledge, no calendaring app offer this option. I would pay to get this.</p>

<p>This one is simply priceless:
<em>“Intel and AMD have learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make decent PC chips. Apple hasn’t just magically figured this out. They’re not going to just walk in.”</em></p>
<p>It’s a liberal transposition of a famous quote on how Apple, a PC guy, just can’t walk in and make a great phone. With the M1 chip, yes, Apple just walked in and did it. Again.</p>
<p>Many pundits were quick to jump the gun on software compatibility issues, the translation layer called Rosetta, the meager 8 GB of RAM, the lack of ports, etc. As proven by the numerous independent reviews, none of these “issues” are  affecting the value of what Apple just did.</p>
<p>It will take a few years before Intel and their friends finally realize what just happened in late 2020 and recover from it. <em>Years.</em></p>

			 <p>Steve Jobs once downplayed flash memory based MP3 players when the iPod was just beginning its ascension. We know what came after the iPod with a small drive. The iPod nano, an MP3 player using flash memory. If you see a stylus, they blew it. The iPad eventually came with support for a stylus&hellip; oops, a pencil. What came after that? Support for a mouse with iPadOS 13.4. See the trend? Are you getting it?</p>
<p>Now, about the Mac. Sure Apple could have used this historic moment to a add touch screen to the M1 MacBook. It didn’t happen. I, myself, was one of them, thinking it was about to happen as exposed <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/11/14/thoughts-on-one-more-thing-the-ultimate-mac-transition/">in this blog post</a>. My short experience with macOS Big Sur updated design screams out loud that we are far closer to a touch supported Mac than Apple is willing to admit.</p>
<p>I don’t know when, but it will come, in a perfectly chosen moment by Apple. Apple likes to move forward, one step at a time. The next window of opportunity is next year with a redesigned MacBook body. This year’s was about the internals while keeping familiarities: performance, battery life and transition. Next year is about redefining the way we look at the MacBook and enhance the way we always knew how to interact with it. The Big Sur update this year is just the first step toward a touch friendly operating system. In a typical Apple way, they will have thoroughly thought about all this and we will be amazed about why it wasn’t done this way before. Next year has the potential to be exciting.</p>

			 <p>In light of all the raving reviews about the M1-based Macs, you might wonder why someone would still need and buy an Intel-based Mac Pro? For many reasons. First, some high-demanding pro software might not be compatible on M1 Macs. Second, if you run software who takes advantage of multiple cores, the Mac Pro with its Xeon processor is hard to beat. Example of this is VMware Fusion. Other use cases demand the most powerful CPU you can get, and they come in the Mac Pro, for now. Third, the Mac Pro is still the most expandable Mac out there. I&rsquo;m one of those contemplating the Mac Pro for <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/29/the-sddcbox-project-part-3-choosing-a-mac-pro-configuration/">my SDDCbox project</a>, but I must say that my priorities shifted a bit.

			 <p>My <strong>AppleOne</strong> signup went weird when it was announced by Apple. I was billed for some of the individual services as well as the bundle. I&rsquo;ve been looking for credits since then, which are still yet to come. I think it will be a mess to fix unless Apple gets their act together before then. Now, it looks like my subscription has ended and I cannot renew it. Something bad is really happening.

The results are pretty worrisome for Intel which seems incapable to go beyond a 10 nm process. Intel will become the emblematic image of inefficient processors for years to come.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Let’s put it straight: <strong>Apple’s Shortcuts</strong> are the weirdest, most cumbersome and utterly frustrating thing to build, test and eventually use. I cannot count how many hours I spent trying to understand their intricacies and most useful use cases. As much as I want to get empowered by them, it often ends in frustration. Here is why.</p>
<p>You cannot disable old shortcuts that are no longer used but that you want to keep as a reference.  There is no way to export them in a clean and readable PDF format. There is a lack of some form of runtime debugging tools. The editor doesn’t scale beyond a few dozens instructions. There is no way to write shortcuts in a text editor à la AppleScript. Share sheets bad design and organization make shortcuts invocation a trial and error experience. As your shortcuts collection grows, it hard to remember which shortcut does what in what context and what is required to launch it. And the list goes on and on. Documentation within the Shortcuts editor is lacking, very limited. A big part of the story is dependant on the willingness of developers to support them. It’s so frustrating to see an app lacking any form of exposure to the shortcut engine.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, I like the idea of automation on the iPad or iPhone. I’m happy to see Apple improving on them with each release of their operating systems. But, there is so much left to cover.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Let&rsquo;s set the tone: Adobe software, Lightroom in particular, is not a very efficient piece of software to use on the Mac&hellip; even on a higher-end configuration. Recent updates in the last year or so tried to improve things a little bit, but there is still a long way to go. It&rsquo;s not clear why Lightroom Classic is so bad. Is it because it is a multi-platform software? Probably. If so, we pay the price at every single use.</p>
<p>Does the M1 chip in a Mac can change the game? Well, yes and no. The following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri8hKJKul5c&amp;feature=emb_title">YouTube video</a> compares Lightroom Classic running on an Intel-based MacBook Pro to an M1-based MacBook Pro. With Rosetta 2 translation layer running to support the non-optimized version of Lightroom Classic, we could think the experience would be awful. In fact, not only it isn&rsquo;t, the M1-based Mac makes the experience a bit better. Who would have thought.</p>
<p>Now, Adobe is working on a native or universal version of Lightroom for the M1 chip. Note that I&rsquo;m referring to Lightroom CC here, the cloud version of Lightroom, not the Classic version. Depending of who you are and what is your relation to photo processing, it may be a good or a bad news. Nonetheless, the prospect of a universal of Lightroom CC is certainly exciting. Will Adobe take advantage of the GPU cores or the ML cores of the M1 chip? I highly doubt it. If the iPad version of Lightroom CC is any indication, though, not all is lost. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

How come I didn&rsquo;t know about this one?? What is it? It&rsquo;s a small utility which helps bring better focus to the active application on your Mac. It does this by dimming the out-of-focus application windows. It works with multiple displays.

			 <p>In a <a href="https://beckyhansmeyer.com/2020/11/25/your-move-ipad/#comments">blog post</a> &ldquo;Your Move, iPad&rdquo;, by Becky Hansmeyer, the author asks <em>&ldquo;So if raw power isn’t enough, and new display tech isn’t enough, where does the iPad go from here? Will it be abandoned once more, lagging behind the Mac in terms of innovation, or will Apple continue to debut its latest tech in this form factor?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>In light of the massively successful M1-powered Macs, what can we infer for the future of the iPad Pro?</strong></p>
<p>Apple doesn&rsquo;t need to add touchscreen to their MacBook line if they unleash the iPad with a much more complete iPadOS experience. I think Apple missed the occasion with iPadOS 14 by not adding a more flexible widgets experience, by refusing to improve external display support and by not revisiting the multitasking interaction model. See? It&rsquo;s not only a matter of adding 5G wireless support or LiDAR or a second USB-C port. These will only be as good as the software will allow them to be useful. The just begun new era for Mac with the M1 chip combined with Apple&rsquo;s tight software integration should give us answers on why the iPad Pro future lies in the software.</p>

			 <p>Here is a super fascinating Twitter thread that I reproduce here. Find the <a href="https://twitter.com/erratarob/status/1331735383193903104?s=21">original tweets here</a>. It&rsquo;s is about Apple Silicon wizardry. For techy people only!</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In case you were wondering: Apple&rsquo;s replacement for Intel processors turns out to work really, really well. Some otherwise skeptical techies are calling it &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It runs Intel code extraordinarily well. The basic reason is that Arm and Intel architectures have converged. Yes, the instruction sets are different, but the underlying architectural issues have become very similar. The biggest hurdle was &ldquo;memory-ordering&rdquo;, the order in which two CPUs see modifications in memory by each other. It&rsquo;s the biggest problem affecting Microsoft&rsquo;s emulation of x86 on their Arm-based &ldquo;Surface&rdquo; laptops. So Apple simply cheated. They added Intel&rsquo;s memory-ordering to their CPU. When running translated x86 code, they switch the mode of the CPU to conform to Intel&rsquo;s memory ordering. With underlying architectural issues ironed out, running x86 code simply means translating those instructions to the Arm equivalent. This is very efficient and results in code that often runs at the same speed. Sometimes there isn&rsquo;t a direct equivalent, so the translation results in slightly slower code, but benchmarks show x86 being consistently at least 70% of the speed. In any case, a surprising number of popular apps already run on it. Apple seeded developer systems a few months back, allowing people to get their code ready. Normally, that wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough time. When you recompile code for a new architecture, it usually breaks. But as I said above: Arm and Intel architectures have converged enough that code is much less likely to break, making recompiling easier. Apple has made surprising choices. They&rsquo;ve optimized JavaScript, with special JavaScript-specific instructions, double sized L1 caches, and probably other tricks I don&rsquo;t know of. Thus, as you browse the web, their new laptop will seem faster and last longer on battery, because JavaScript, even though other benchmarks show it roughly the same speed as Intel/AMD. The older MacBook Air had a dual core CPU that ran at 3.8 GHz, but when in low-power mode, 1.2 GHz. Switching between fast and slow modes is how it conserves power for mobile. But it&rsquo;s ultimately inefficient. The Intel CPU is designed to run at 5 GHz. Downclocking to 1 GHz saves power &ndash; but not as much as if you&rsquo;d designed the processor to run at 1 GHz to begin with. Apple&rsquo;s strategy is to use two processors: one designed to run fast above 3 GHz, and the other to run slow below 2 GHz. Apple calls this their &ldquo;performance&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. Each optimized to be their best at their goal. When they need to conserve power, they turn off the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; processors and run code on their &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. They have 4x performance processors (twice that of their older Macs) plus 4x efficiency processors. All 8 can be active. When doing something that can use 8 processors, such as compiling code, it goes real REAL fast. 8 processors vs. 2 processors in their old notebooks make a difference. A big part of this story is that Intel is about 3 years behind on Moore&rsquo;s Law. Apple Silicon uses the latest 5nm tech from TMSC, while Intel uses the older 10nm/7nm generation. Much of Intel&rsquo;s product line uses the even older 14nm/10nm generation. None of this is actual &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all pretty understandable. It&rsquo;s just all the various things have been executed really well, leading to a combined result that is a great leap forward. Another &ldquo;magic&rdquo; trick is how their &ldquo;Swift&rdquo; programming language uses &ldquo;reference counting&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;garbage collection&rdquo; in Android. They did something in their CPU to double the speed of reference counting. &hellip;even when translating x86 code, all that reference counting overhead (already more efficient than garbage collection) gets dropped in half. Yet another weird performance enhance to add to all the others.&rdquo;</em></p>

It is inevitable. Apple’s focus this year was on the internals but I expect them to switch to the outside on the next iterative evolution of the Mac mini. Besides physical compatibility reasons, a much smaller Mac mini, close to the size of an Apple TV for example could be in store. One possible constrain is the number of ports Apple will have to squeeze on the back. If they keep the same number of ports, the newly redesigned Mac mini could be something in-between the current one and the Apple TV. We’ll see. Meanwhile, I’ll patiently wait for my own M1-based Mac mini to arrive in 28 days. Its external size won’t matter much to me.</p>

			 <p>A lot has been written on Apple switch to their own processors already. But one side of the story is still lacking some insight. Apple is probably saving a lot of money by putting their own Apple silicon in each Mac they sell. According to <a href="https://sumitgup.medium.com/why-did-apple-build-their-own-arm-m1-cpu-chip-2fdd88db9b36">this Medium article</a>, Apple could save at least $2 billion a year with just three entry level MacBook sporting the M1 chip. We can only try to approximate the amount of money Apple is no longer paying to Intel. We can also start wondering the amount of money Apple has directly invested in developing the M1 chip and how fast they wil recoup their investments. My gut feeling says that it will be fast.</p>

			 <p>Here is a simple theory. This year&rsquo;s MacBook didn&rsquo;t bring an upgrade to the FaceTime HD camera, and unanimously, people is complaining. But what if this lack of attention to the very specific feature from Apple is part of a bigger plan for next year&rsquo;s MacBook? Here is my guess.</p>
<p>Apple is targeting next year for the real deal: the full redesign of the MacBook line to be announced around WWDC 2021. Part of this plan would include much better FaceTime HD camera assembly that would include Face ID, a highly expected feature for M1-based machines. Offered in sizes of 12&quot;, 14&quot; and 16&quot; with an impossibly thin screen bezel, Apple wanting to keep the size of these machines the smallest possible as the power sipping CPU can handle smaller batteries yet providing long battery life. I would expect the M1x chip as the more powerful M2 one would go to the iMac, iMac Pro. The new MacBook, to be named MacBook X, will will mark the first year of the Apple silicon transition.</p>
<p>Until then, keep enjoying your Apple Silicon Mac, version 1.</p>

			 <p>On Substack, I recently stumble on an interesting article from <a href="https://apple.substack.com">https://apple.substack.com</a>: when Apple introduces a new round of Macs next year, what if they keep previous generation around but at a lower price point?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a highly possible scenario considering how Apple under Tim Cook operates. The iPhone models multiplication, same is happening with the watch&hellip;. next, the Mac? Probably. Is this a good thing? For their bottom line probably, yes, but for the customers? Yes and no.. yes, it makes the brand more accessible but it makes the buying experience a little bit more complicated than it should be with fewer models available. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>

			 <p>Following of new round of benchmarks from MacRumors, my take outs are: 16 GB is (much) better than 8 GB from a speed point of view (well, duh!), the Mac mini is the best most of the time with a few exception (slower than MBP on SSD write speed is one such exemple, hard to explain). Adobe Lightroom Classic doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of the RAM difference, which is not surprising to me (thanks to multiplatforms Adobe&rsquo;s software) You can get all the details from MacRumors website: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/23/apple-m1-hands-on-comparison-macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-vs-mac-mini/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/23/m1-macbook-pro-ram-differences/">here</a>.

			 <p>Many are asking if they should go with a 16 GB RAM configuration for their new M1-based MacBook Air. Some others think Apple should have made a 32 GB of RAM configuration for the 13” MacBook Pro. According to this <a href="https://youtu.be/Tq3Zc8jmf0Y">informal benchmarking video</a>, 8 GB seems enough for most people. During his tests, the user opened many different apps and documents in Excel, tabs in Chrome, Photoshop and the MacBook Air stayed cool and never ever started to fall on its knees. At no time the idle CPU metric went down below 60%. The fan-less computer never got hot. Why? Three letters: SoC.</p>
<p>The M1 chip gathers many different components close together on the same chip so they don&rsquo;t have to go through the PCI bus to move data around. I think it plays a big role in Apple Silicon Macs efficiency. We can no longer compare the RAM configuration of an Apple Mac with a Wintel machine, just like we cannot compare a 12 GB of RAM Android phone to a 6 GB of RAM iPhone. It&rsquo;s just two different worlds.</p>
<p>Yet, I ordered a 16 GB Mac mini. 😳</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, <strong>Pixelmator Pro</strong> is one of the best app in the Apple ecosystem for three reasons. First, the Pixelmator team is always fast to take advantage of Apple&rsquo;s latest software and hardware technologies. Second, it&rsquo;s a real native app, designed and built for the Mac. Third, Pixelmator Pro is close to how Apple&rsquo;s own apps should be designed. Make no mistake, I love Apple&rsquo;s iWork. Pixelmator feels familiar and Apple-ish, something that I like. They probably read the HIG documentation dozen of times. Congrats to them.</p>
<p>Oh, and look at this “What&rsquo;s new&quot; welcome page when you first launch the app after upgrading to version 2.0. Look familiar to you? Can’t  wait to install this on my upcoming Mac mini.</p>

			 <p>Here is what I&rsquo;m hoping to see from reviewers of the M1-based Macs today. How fast is the machine booting? Is wake from sleep that much better? When you start a non-optimized app, how does Rosetta 2 kicks in? How long does it take? What happens when you start the same app a second time after a while? Was Rosetta kick out and has to relaunch? How is window resizing doing, we know that was never really fast on Intel-based machines. How is scrolling speed in Photos? Can you really feel the difference on an optimized app compared to their Intel counterpart? Does installing 11.0.1 update was faster than on previous macOS release on Intel? Is the Mac mini the fastest among the three? Does GPU intensive tasks are really that much faster? What about SSD speed for reads and writes compared to an Intel Mac? is it much improved? Is macOS Big Sur buggier than on Intel? Is 8 GB of RAM enough or 16 GB is really a must? Have you tried Pixelmator Pro, how fast is it now?</p>

<p>My wish is to install Universal apps only as I don’t want to trigger Rosetta 2.</p>

			 <p>In light of Apple&rsquo;s recent products introduction, consider the recently introduced <strong>Microsoft Surface Go</strong>. A Windows laptop that starts with 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB SSD, 12.4” touch screen using the Intel Core i5 which will get you 13 hours on battery for 550$. If you want a 8 GB of RAM, 256 GB SSD, the price goes up to 899$, but you keep the same lame CPU.</p>
<p>Now, compare this to the new MacBook Air (a much more powerful laptop) for 899$ (education pricing), same amount of RAM and SSD, 5 hours more of battery life, a much better non-touch display.</p>
<p>How is Microsoft supposed to compete against Apple in this market now?</p>
<p>They simply can’t, and they should start to worry.</p>

It’s exactly the kind of review that I’m looking for. Visuals and internal architectural features are exposed, explained but rarely justified, only when it serves a purpose of contextualizing the matter. Kudos for the author: Andrew Cunningham</p>
<p>Now, I’m so anxious to get this thing running on my upcoming Mac mini. Big Sur is not only a refresh of the user interface but also an important sum of things under the hood that is being upgraded and modernized.</p>

			 <p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong with my perception of the disaster Apple created with the introduction of widgets in combination with notifications center (read <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/11/01/im-done-with.html">my comment here on micro.blog</a>). After reading the excellent <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macos-big-sur-the-macstories-review/">MacStories.net review of Big Sur</a>, I finally saw the combination in action. Notifications are see big improvements and look closer to what we get on iOS.</p>
<p>Still, Apple lost the opportunity to make widgets available in their own space, something like what we used to have, the Dashboard. It&rsquo;s ridiculous to confine widgets in such a small space, considering modern screen sizes. Oh, and I hope the interaction feels much more fluid on M1-based machines because the last time checked on a 2017 MacBook Pro, with Big Sur beta 10, it was super laggy</p>

			 <p>Twitter is ablaze since yesterday when first benchmarks of the MacBook Air were published. They show the M1-based and fan-less Mac to surpass the top of the line iMac! It’s impressive if not mind-blowing!</p>
<p>Now here is a simple theory: native apps will certainly perform really well but non-native apps will run under the Rosetta layer, which happens to consume CPU cycles. This performance room being consumed by Rosetta, the actual performance of a non native app will probably fall down to a more reasonable level.</p>
<p>Impressive nonetheless.</p>

<p>I’m going to make the plunge into the world of Apple Silicon-based Mac, Big Sur and universal apps. It’s the beginning of a new era, and I want to be part of it, experience it. I’m not waiting for the reviews next week.</p>
<p>I’ll get a Mac mini equipped with 16 GB of RAM and a 1 TD SSD. Expected delivery date is mi-December at the earliest, just in time for Christmas holidays. I never owned a Mac mini, BTW.</p>
<p>I’ll use my 4K LG display that is currently plugged into my iMac. I’ll be testing universal apps as they come out. Applications like Adobe Lightroom CC, Omnigraffle and Pixelmator Photo will certainly take advantage of the M1 processor.</p>

			 <p>Here is the thing: the new M1-based Macs use the new &ldquo;<strong>unified memory architecture</strong>” that is at the center of our iPhones and iPads. If you plan to buy one of these shinny new Mac, my recommendation would be to go with 16 GB of RAM, not 8 GB. Why? Consider this: Rosetta 2 is a new emulation software layer that will consume memory, something that is not present on Intel-based machines. On top of that, memory will be consume for video processing. My guess is: the biggest monitoring, the higher the resolution, the more memory will be consumed. What’s left for the applications? Even if SSD is fast on reads and writes, application launches are fast, nothing equals the speed of RAM. I&rsquo;m afraid 8 GB of RAM is the new meager 5 GB iCloud storage tier for M1-based Mac. We&rsquo;ll see with the upcoming reviews and benchmarks.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs reminds the crowd of transitions in Mac history: 68K to PowerPC, OS 9 to OS 10 then introduces the third transition: going to Intel. Each time, he uses the expression “to set Apple for the next 10 years&quot;. It&rsquo;s all about the CPU roadmap’s ability to enable the Apple&rsquo;s vision. Also, even at that time, power consumption was an issue. He also repeatedly mention great updates still coming to the PowerPC-based Macs.</p>

			 <p>This quote from the Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s review of the <strong>iPhone 12 Pro Max</strong> is priceless as ti summarize one of the biggest issue, in my opinion, about Apple’s current state of its software in general:</p>
<p><em>“It is crazy to me, however, that Apple hasn&rsquo;t enabled us to do more on a phone that is practically iPad-size. Why can&rsquo;t I view my inbox on the top half of the screen and my calendar on the bottom, like Samsung allows with its Multi-Window mode? Why does the tiny iPhone Mini allow the same number of rows of home-page app icons and widgets as the iPhone Giant? Why can&rsquo;t I use an Apple Pencil to take notes on the notebook-size device?”</em></p>
<p>These are all valid questions. Even before the iPhone 12 Pro Max, these questions were valid. Software, like for the iPad, is holding back the iPhone. Is it a ressources issue being spread too thin? Is it something about product differentiation? I hope the answer is the former, not the latter.</p>

			 <p>I have a feeling that we are in for some deception tomorrow at the “One More Thing” keynote. Is this a natural mental process, some sort of auto-regulation of my own expectations, currently happening so I can be pleasantly surprised, tomorrow?</p>
<p>Yet, reading my Twitter feed today and people are expecting 15 hours of battery life while beating current Mac equivalent performance. And then what? The Apple Silicon story is more about the unification of software platforms at Apple than enabling endless hardware innovations on the Mac.</p>
<p>Change my mind.</p>

			 <p>After spending sometime with the <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/11/08/my-iphone-virtual.html">virtual experience from Apple</a>, I found out another one by the well known <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelsteeber?s=21">@MichaelSteeber</a> that is built with Adobe’s XD. The experience is quite similar, and I’m still not able to find a fully satisfactory combinaison of the iPhone, the MagSafe case and the wallet. Really, the iPhone 12 is not for me.</p>

			 <p>Apple launched a <a href="https://experience.apple/iphone">webpage</a> to experience the selection and visualization of different MagSafe cases and wallets for the iPhone 12. I played with it for fun from my iPad Pro. It’s an interesting way to try different combinaisons of iPhone, cases and wallet in a world where going to a real store to do the same is challenging.</p>
<p>This year’s iPhone and cases prove to be hardly satisfactory, though. The colours options are not really in line to my tastes. After spending a while, I found two probable configurations that I would buy if I was on the market for such things. Because of bad reviews of the wallet, I would skip this one as I would fear losing my three most important cards. I hope Apple will fix the issues with next year’s round of the products.</p>

			 <p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/leaksapplepro/status/1322608644928790528?s=21">recent tweet</a> from @LeaksApplePro made me think about the significance of the iPhone 12 in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Apple is about to remove the last port on the iPhone, so they are training us with the MagSafe. Next year’s version will fix many of the issue we’re facing today. 5G may not be ready, but next year it will be much better. LiDAR is fascinating, but next year we will depend on it. We tend to forget about the notch, next year it will be Apple who will forget it by putting it to rest.</p>
<p>We’re still in the middle of the pandemic. We’re not out of the woods. We’ll continue to work from home for a long time. Trips are not really a thing right now. But, in the fall of 2021, can we hope that most of this will be behind us and return to normal life? It would help a lot to enjoy the portless iPhone 13 or whatever stupid name they will name it. Right now, I’m a bit tired of not being able to go out and use the cameras to build my visual memories.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 is the transition iPhone that will lead us to a better world, a year from now. I hope.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Mac has gone through many transitions in the past and I was there for each of them. From the Motorola CPU, to the PowerPC and the Intel processors, Apple’s execution was almost flawless.</p>
<p>At the upcoming Apple Event, Apple will unveil their highly anticipated Apple Silicon Macs. When thinking about what Apple could do for this pivotal moment for the Mac, there is two possible roads Apple can take in regards to the general design of these machines.</p>
<p>First, Apple could choose to do the same they did when they switched to Intel processors back in 2005. Apple kept the same designs. There are a few advantages to this approach. By going the conservative way, Apple sends a &ldquo;don’t worry, this is a Mac, everything will work just fine” message. This would probably helps keep the confidence level about the expected compatibility of these machines with current software. But there is one big drawback from a marketing standpoint: Apple chose to switch to its own CPU in order to enable new things on the Mac that wasn&rsquo;t possible before. I&rsquo;m not sure that keeping the same external design of the Mac is the best way to do it; it would be too conservative.</p>
<p>The second approach, the one that I prefer, would be for Apple to introduce a refreshed and modernized design. This could take the form of new materials, new textures, new tones. Screen bezels could be dramatically reduced in order to bring the machine down in size. On top of that, better FaceTime camera with 4K resolution, always-on Siri could also make their debuts. If battery life can show major improvements, Apple would have a winner here. Such a move by Apple would help mark the turning point for the Mac, a new era, just like they did in 2012 when they introduced the unibody design. The Mac is in need of such refresh and this is the right time to do it.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/05/2-5m-apple-silicon-macbooks-by-february-2021/?utm_source=osx&amp;utm_medium=push&amp;utm_campaign=">Apple is really aiming to produce 2.5 million Apple Silicon MacBooks by February 2021</a>, there has to be something special besides a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/05/a14x-bionic-allegedly-benchmarked-days-before-apple-silicon-mac-event">powerful and power efficient A14X CPU</a>. Let&rsquo;s see which strategy Apple decided to chose.</p>
<p>Side note: it is fascinating to see that the PC never went through these transitions like the Mac did. It is something unique in the technology world. No other company ever did this, that many times. Now, we might wonder if this Apple Silicon transition will spark a similar move in the Wintel world. Why? Because Intel is no longer a synonym of real platform evolution, ARM-based design is.</p>

			 <p>In the last few weeks, I repeatedly got a simple question regarding the <strong>Apple Watch: does it require an iPhone</strong>? One person expected to &ldquo;pair” the watch with an iPad. The other is an Android user. These questions tell me something interesting. One, the Apple Watch is gaining traction among non-Apple users. Two, the quicker Apple can remove the iPhone requirement to get an Apple Watch, the better it will be for their bottom line. This could be something as important as the iTunes for Windows was back in the days.</p>

			 <p>Here’s a quick and unrelated question: how old, on average, are people who love the design language of macOS Big Sur? Seriously, my bet goes to a much younger crowd than those who prefer macOS Catalina. Why? People who grew up with the iPhone and iPadOS has a much different design reference frame that those who grew up with macOS. The latter group seems to see Big sur as some sort of iPadification of macOS.</p>

<ul>
<li>macOS 11.0 &ldquo;Big Sur&rdquo; make its official debuts (100%)</li>
<li>Universal apps running simultaneously on iOS, iPadOS and macOS are now supported (100%)</li>
<li>First round of Apple Silicon Macs are release: MacBook or MacBook Pro (100%)</li>
<li>Side announcements of updated configurations for 21.5” iMac and 27” iMac Pro still on Intel (70%)</li>

			 <p>According to <a href="https://appletrack.org/many-13-macbook-pro-21-5-imac-models-out-of-stock-ahead-of-rumored-november-event/">AppleTrack.org</a>, there is a shortage of many different Mac models. Some shipping dates are slipping into December. It the case for the 21.5” iMac and iMac Pro. Troubling.</p>
<p>When Apple announced they were transitioning their Macs to use the new Apple Silicon, they also said they would keep updating current Intel-based models for a while. I don&rsquo;t know this will translate in reality. If the iMac Pro is being updated this month, it could be for an updated configuration with an Intel CPU, not an Apple Silicon. The case of the 21.5” iMac is more interesting, tough. The 27” iMac was updated recently but not the 21.5. I&rsquo;m not sure it is the first prime candidate for the Apple Silicon. I&rsquo;m thinking more about the MacBook or the MacBook Pro which would highly benefit from the Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the Mac Pro is still in stock. This could signal that it won&rsquo;t get updated this fall. The Mac Pro wasn&rsquo;t updated since its release in 2019. As I&rsquo;m looking to get one for <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/25/the-sddcbox-project-part-1-an-introduction/">my SDDCbox project</a>, I&rsquo;d would love to see a refreshed configuration in time for me to consider and pickup.</p>

			 <p>One of my favorite macOS utilities, <strong>iStat Menus</strong>, just received an update to version 6.5 which adds support for <strong>macOS Big Sur</strong>. I know, yesterday I wrote that <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/11/01/im-done-with.html">I was done with Big Sur</a>&hellip; but it was for testing&hellip; I still have time in front of me to convince me this is the best release of macOS Apple has ever done.</p>
<p>iStat Menus will be ready when I&rsquo;m doing the switch to this Mac Pro for <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/25/the-sddcbox-project-part-1-an-introduction/">my SDDCbox project</a>. It will play an important role in giving me insights on the CPU and SSD access. For now, there are a lot of tweaks which will make this utility even better. Even their release notes is art!</p>
<p>There seems to be less and less high-quality apps and utilities like this these days&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Since the beginning of September I’ve been testing macOS Big Sur. I&rsquo;m still undecided about how I like or hate this release. I&rsquo;m unable to get over the way Apple messed up the notifications center with widgets. Clearly, it is a regression. There was no good reasons to merge them on the same space. Widgets should have gone in their own area, taking full advantage of the big screen. I just don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll reuse this 1 TB SSD USB-C drive for something else: put <a href="https://numericcitizen.medium.com/the-sddcbox-project-part-4-from-imac-to-mac-pro-916db3b260c">my SDDCbox project</a> virtual machines on it.</p>

			 <p>Here is a fascinating chart: brand value calculated by Interbrand. Apple is on top again this year. They have been there since 2012. What I find interesting is the first row is occupied by companies reflecting our new way of life as we depend on smartphones (Apple, Samsung), online shopping (Amazon) and the cloud (Microsoft). What about Google you might ask? Well, first, as we don’t like to pay for online stuff, we prefer to be the product of advertisers. Second, we stopped using bookmarks a long time ago, we prefer the Google search field.</p>

			 <p>“Work can’t solve for all the things we’re missing right now, but a shared sense of purpose goes a long way. A belief that we can do more together than we can alone, that people of good will, driven by creativity and passion and that certain itch of a big idea, can still do things that help other people in our own small way to teach, to learn, to create, or just to relax at a time like this. Even as the things we make require us to operate at the very cutting edge of technology, in materials, products, and ideas that didn’t exist just a few years ago, <strong>this year has forced us to face plainly the things that make us human — disease, resilience, and hope.</strong>” — Tim Cook</p>

			 <p>I’m always impressed by the turn over speed of major new releases of iOS. iOS 14 adoption rate is already surpassing iOS 13 after less than six weeks of availability. Wow.</p>
<p>Apple’s iPhone ecosystem is running at blazing speed to adopt new technologies. There is nothing like that in tech. Even if people are keeping their old iPhone longer, by supporting old devices, Apple can set the bar for new privacy features and make them available to a vast portion of the users. This is something we rarely talk about.</p>

There was a story to hit so people could understand the &ldquo;why&rsquo;s&rdquo;. Now, in the age of smartphones, what is the relevancy for Apple Silicon Macs? Why now? What pain points do they address? Can&rsquo;t wait for November.

			 <p>_“Enduring design doesn’t need constant reinterpretation. It needs tweaking, polishing, and subtle improvement”  _— Om Malik</p>
<p>Great take by Om Malik on the the significance of timeless design in “<a href="https://om.co/2020/10/23/iphone-12-and-why-great-design-is-timeless/">Why great design is timeless</a>”. As I wrote in <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/10/25/apple-did-it.html">my previous post</a>, to me, the iPhone 5 was the best Apple design before the iPhone 12. Om Malik refers to the iPhone 4 as being an example of timeless design that was later only tweaked, refined and polished in following iPhone iterations. I find it a bit surprising as the iPhone 4 metallic edges never really came back after the iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Looking back at the iPhone design genealogy, we can infer six major groups of iPhone design language: the original iPhone up to the iPhone 3GS is group #1, the iPhone 4 and 4S is group #2, the iPhone 5, 5S and SE is group #3, the iPhone 6 and 6S is group #4,  the group #5 encompasses the iPhone 7 up to the iPhone 11 including the SE 2. Finally, group #6 is the iPhone 12. I expect Apple to iterate within that group for at least another year.</p>
<p>The iterative polishing, refining process of Apple is in full glory since the iPhone 7. The latter is heavily based on the iPhone 5 heritage. The iPhone 12 is heavily inspired by the iPhone 5 era and the group #5 of designs.</p>
<p>If Apple plays their card well, next year&rsquo;s iPhone could surpass this year&rsquo;s line up by fixing the Pro glossy edges, removing the notch (it won&rsquo;t happen), thinner bezels and less controversial colours selection, just to name a few attributes.</p>

			 <p>In my opinion, this year&rsquo;s black iPhone 12 is now their best design of all time, surpassing their previously best design, the black iPhone 5. It took them 8 years. I can&rsquo;t wait to see that in person, for now, <a href="https://twitter.com/bmacadelic/status/1319793464389894146?s=21">this tweet by Brian MacDuff</a> is enough to convince me. Blacks are deep blacks, the edges mat finish is way better than on the Pro models. What could come next to beat this? A notch-less design. Maybe next year or in 8 years. Who knows.

			 <p>I recently got this notification on my iPhone. I didn’t know the exposure feature would keep the user informed about its “behind-the-scene” work. Interesting.</p>
<p>I wonder how Apple will remove that from iOS in a post-pandemic world. Will they keep it and make it usable for other types of highly contagious deceases? My feeling is that they will generalize it and keep there.</p>

It&rsquo;s an interesting move. We tend to forget how massive the required logistic is needed for these roll outs to happen smoothly, year after year. This year is special, the pandemic is certainly increasing the difficulty level quite a bit for Apple. We&rsquo;ll see how Apple&rsquo;s bottom line is affected, later this year.</p>

			 <p>In a surprising move, Airbnb has a new partnership with Apple&rsquo;s former designer chief, Jony Ive. As much as I like this guy’s work, something quite surprising struck me: Airbnb doesn&rsquo;t sell any form of hardware. The last time I check, Jony Ive’s reputation is not about crafting the best user interface designs in the world, far from it. Who remember the switch to iOS 7? I do. Jony Ive was quite instrumental in the design of iOS 7 and it was a disaster. We are still paying the price today. It will be interesting to watch what comes from this partnership.

			 <p>My possible future Mac Pro configuration is taking shape. It all <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/10/18/a-wild-dream.html">started here</a> btw. Reading carefully the spec sheet, the base configuration sets the memory clock speed at 2666 MHz while the 12 cores CPU configuration is at 2933 MHz. Considering my use case, virtualization with VMware Fusion, I&rsquo;ll take any non-GPU improvements possible. Speaking of GPU, I&rsquo;m not sure about the performance difference between the base GPU card, a AMD Radeon Pro 580X, and the more powerful AMD Radeon Pro W5500X. I&rsquo;ll probably keep the entry-level one saving memory for a bigger SSD. Maybe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not close yet to make the plunge and I&rsquo;ll have to wait for November announcements as configuration updates, price changes or something else could greatly affect my buying decision. Stay tuned for update #3.</p>

			 <p>Thanks to iPhone 12, I can&rsquo;t wait for the iPhone 13. The MagSafe is cool but is not perfect. 5G is nice but comes with a spotty coverage and puts a lot of pressure on battery life. The iPhone 12 Pro is a powerful monster but with fingerprint magnets and fragile glossy edges. Bezels are thinner and thinner but this big notch is still there. I’m skipping this year’s iPhone 12 and anxiously waiting for iPhone 13. Or whatever name they call it. Maybe just: iPhone Pro?</p>

			 <p>With the iPhone 12 and MagSafe, is Apple training us for a port-less iPhone 13? I think so. The removable of the Lightning port and skipping USB-C would be so Apple, an act of courage I guess. If they do remove all the ports from the iPhone, how do we deal with CarPlay? What about developers who use testing and development devices which requires the fastest transfer speed possible? Is there something in the works at Apple that would mitigates these challenges for the users? Another type of adaptor? Or maybe Apple is just waiting for a more drastic iPhone redesign (no notch?) to bend themselves to USB-C?</p>

<p>I think 5G is more marketing than anything else at this point. The iPhone 12 will be the enabler of 5G network. People will demand it (even if their use cases don&rsquo;t require it). This will in turn force operators to accelerate their deployment.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve been thinking of something really wild recently, for me at least: <strong>replacing my 2017 21.5 inches iMac with a Mac Pro</strong>. Here is why.</p>
<p>I work in IT (information technologies) as a data center related technology architect. Server virtualization, storage area networks, networking technologies are at the center of my professional universe. In the coming months, I’ll have to invest in self-training and experimentations a lot around VMware-related products and services. How can I do that efficiently while working from home? Here comes the Mac Pro idea.</p>
<p>In order to be able to run many virtual machines, a powerful physical computer is required: lots of memory, powerful CPU (more than 6 cores) and fast storage. My current iMac doesn’t meet these basic requirements (it is maxed out at 32 GB of RAM and it has a relatively modest CPU). A Mac Pro with the following specs would easily meet the challenge: at least 128 GB of fast memory, 8 cores CPU, builtin SSD and expandability.</p>
<p>Virtualization will required VMware Fusion Pro running on top of macOS. Then, the sky is the limit as I can then install ESXi hypervisor which will allow me to branch into more complex setup. This type of environment do require a lot of memory (a typical VM is about 4-16 GB each) and multi-cores CPU. Installing ESXi directly on the Mac Pro is not an option as I will need to have macOS running for all other tasks (I’m not even sure if it is att all possible).</p>
<p>How do I get there? Well, I’m still thinking about how I’ll buy that machine and get the additional RAM (I won’t go with Apple’s because $$$). Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Technical datasheet can be found on Apple’s website, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/mac-pro/pdf/Mac_Pro_White_Paper_Feb_2020.pdf">right here in PDF format</a>. I don’t want to switch to a Windows machine BTW, I’m too much invested in Apple’s ecosystem for that to happen.</p>

		<a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2020/10/17/a-follow-up.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-10-17 14:07:17 -0500">Oct 17, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In a recent blog post, the well known blogger and content creator, Matt Birchler, wants to understand why so many people are opting for emails (newsletters) over the web. I want to give my perspective on each of his questions.</p>
<p><em><strong>What about writing in a newsletter is more enjoyable than writing for a blog?</strong></em></p>
<p>My <em><a href="https://numericcitizen.substack.com">Numeric Citizen Introspection</a></em> newsletter is a monthly one. I start writing the next issue at the beginning of each month. I hit “Publish and send” at the very end of each month. It gives me four weeks to nurture its content. When the end of the month approaches, the newsletter content is mostly complete and I like how it evolved from the beginning. It is a satisfying process. Then, I take a pause and look forward to start the next one. I like the regular beat of all this process. I wouldn’t do a weekly newsletter, though, as it requires much more time to do.</p>
<p><em><strong>Are newsletter audiences more engaged than blog subscribers?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m not sure about this one in general. For me, it is too early to tell. My gut feeling is that people are more or less engaged the same way as they are with blogs. I’d like to be wrong, though, and have people engage more with newsletters.</p>
<p><em><strong>As a reader, do you prefer reading in your email app to an RSS app (or just the web in general)?</strong></em></p>
<p>I use Substack to build and send my newsletters. Each of them are also available via an RSS feed. Depending of the client used, the reading experience can be enjoyable on both type of clients. Personally, I do subscribe to Hey and reading newsletters with their client is really nice and provides a nice clipping feature which is very handy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you not miss things like link posts and “going viral” which are much harder, if impossible to do with emails?</strong></em></p>
<p>Link posts can be done in newsletters and they won’t go viral for sure. But, I’m not really looking for this kind of fame to be honest.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is it easier to get people to sign up for a paid subscription compared to the web?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m still building this stuff and my newsletter is free for now. I get new subscribers regularly but not as much as I would like. I guess I still have to get the word out and be more “famous”.</p>

<p><strong>Widgets</strong>. News Explorer hasn’t been updated to support them yet. Reeder now does. I love them. <strong>Read Later</strong>.

			 <p>For the first time in my numeric life (at least, from what I’m aware of), one of my article has been robbed by another guy. After discovering it, I asked for immediate removal but without success. So, today, I’m calling him out.</p>
<p>The robbed article is the one about upgrading from an Apple Watch Series 4 to Series 6 <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/03/upgrading-from-an-apple-watch-series-4-to-series-6/">published on my main blog on October 3 of 2020</a> and on Medium. You can see <a href="https://www.duggu24.com/upgrading-from-an-apple-watch-series-4-to-series-6/">the stolen article there</a>. This article was then pushed on <a href="https://twitter.com/iamketyperry/status/1316023257884053511?s=21">this fake Twitter account</a> with 1628 followers. This Twitter account is apparently owned or operated <a href="https://twitter.com/duggu24?s=21">by this guy, the thieve</a> who is following four people and has only one follower (poor guy).</p>
<p>This hosting website seems to enjoy quite a bit of traffic. Good for him. All his articles is stolen stuff without any mention of the source. He must be proud of himself, I wonder if his parents are, though?</p>
<p>The main take out: I’m must be a good writer after all so people are starting to notice and copy my stuff.</p>

			 <p>As great looking and powerful the shinny new iPhone 12 Pro might be, I&rsquo;ll skip the upgrade this year. Sure, I tend to skip a few generations but there is one unexpected reason not to do so and another one more obvious. First, the problem is because of the current pandemic, I cannot see when I&rsquo;ll return traveling around the world. Traveling is the best photography opportunity for me. Without travel, working from home all the time, there is no need to get the latest smartphone technology. Second, 5G networks maybe powerful, but the coverage is spotty at best. I prefer to wait a year for this coverage to increase before making the jump on the new iPhone.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2019/09/28/from-iphone-7-to-iphone-11-pro-the-return-of-delights/">I upgraded from an iPhone 7 to an iPhone 11 Pro and I was delighted</a>.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, just like mostly everyday since March 13th of 2020, I went for a long walk with my wife. Both of us had their AirProds Pro with us. I had the idea to try the audio sharing feature of iOS 14 (introduced in iOS 13 if I&rsquo;m not mistaken). We both put our AirPods in and I selected a playlist. Then, using the media playback UI, I selected the audio sharing option, waited for my wife&rsquo;s AirPods to show up, after tapping this pair, she then had to accept my invitation and voilà! We both had music in our ears! It’s a great case of “It Just Works”, something that we see less and less often these days, I guess.</p>

			 <p>The rising popularity of paid newsletters is good news for many reasons. First, it&rsquo;s a signal that people are willing to pay for great content without ads all around it. Second, some people value the direct relationship feeling with the writer compared to a traditional website. Third, the popularity of independent writing is rising which is giving back control to the writers.</p>
<p>In a recent article by Nick Heer on Pixel Envy, the author writes:</p>
<p><em>Yet, despite all of these clear advantages, I still find it difficult to think of my email inbox as somewhere I will go to find something enjoyable to read.</em></p>
<p>I find newsletters a wonderful medium that cut the noise from social networks. The reading experience can further be improved with a great email client like Basecamp&rsquo;s Hey which provides a specific reading mode for newsletters call The Feed. You can read my review of this email client <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/07/24/my-thoughts-on-hey-and-why-im-paying-for-emails-in-2020/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Read more comments from Mr. Heer in his <a href="https://pxlnv.com/blog/paid-email-newsletters/">blog post</a>. <a href="https://numericcitizen.substack.com/p/finding-my-newsletter-purpose">I started a newsletter a few weeks ago</a>. For now and the foreseeable future, it will be free. I have to prove myself that I can meet the deadline every month with quality content. I&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here is a super interesting article from David Shayer on Tidbits about <a href="https://tidbits.com/2020/10/08/four-reasons-why-we-wont-see-third-party-apple-watch-faces-and-what-apple-is-doing-instead/">why there may never be third-party Apple Watch Faces</a>. According to this software engineer who worked on the first two releases of watchOS, there may be four reasons why Apple probably won’t make a watch face store: battery life, buggy code, Apple’s image, copyright worries. Besides many interesting insights on watchOS development and testing, the reason that caught my attention is about Apple desire to control their image.</p>
<p>What is the killer app of the Apple Watch? The watch face, duh! Apple is an image control freak and I don’t think they want a watch face store full of crappy and bad taste designs to show up on users’ Apple Watch. They lost control of the App Store, they don’t want the same story to happen with the watch. And I agree with this position. But there could be some sort of compromise, though. As pointed out by Matt Birchler in <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/4-reasons-apple-may-not-allow-third-party-watch-faces/">his commentary post</a> to Tidbits article:</p>
<p>“<em>CarPlay is a great example of how Apple could do this right with watch faces: only allow a certain number of companies to make custom watch faces. have them sign additional agreements and have them go through tougher reviews. Maybe there are literally 10 companies who are able to make watch faces. Maybe Apple can reject a watch face simply because they don’t like how it looks.</em>”</p>
<p>My guess is that Apple will look to add more watch faces through collaborative work, just like they did in watchOS 7 with the Artist watch face.</p>

			 <p>Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/apple-prepares-to-launch-5g-iphones-into-unready-u-s-market">via Mark Gurman</a>, is reporting that Apple will hold another event in November for <strong>Apple Silicon Macs</strong>. Besides <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/10/10/on-the-upcoming.html">my comments yesterday</a> on the opportunity for Apple to present redesigned Macs, having a separate event is a no brainer to me. This is a major transition for Apple and they certainly wants to get the message loud and clear.</p>
<p>If rumors are sound, Apple still have some time ahead to polish the upcoming macOS Big Sur release. <em>As it is today, it is not ready for prime time</em>. It may be the equivalent of the iOS 13 buggy release of this year. Even if Apple announces Macs in November, they could be ready to ship only in December, who knows, giving Apple even more time. Anyhow, I’m not is a rush to upgrade to Big Sur. Apps will have to follow the new look and feel and I’ll wait for them to be updated first. The list is long.</p>

			 <p>While many pundits still wonder which Mac Apple will start transitioning the platform to their shiny and speedy silicon, my attention is on something else. I’m wondering if Apple will take this opportunity to introduce redesigned machines. Let’s say they start with the MacBook Pro, could they use this occasion to reimagine the laptop? What about the iMac which is way overdue for a redesign?</p>
<p>There are two avenues for Apple. One in which they opt for continuity. The other is to make a bold statement and turn the page on the Intel-based era. If prefer the latter as I’d like to see what it looks like after the era of Jony Ive. It’s a golden opportinity IMHO. Besides my preference, <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/09/23/the-rotten-side-of-tim-cooks-apple/">Tim Cook’s Apple is conservative</a> and they will probably opt for the former approach.</p>

			 <p>Here are a few quick comments on <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/deliveries/id290986013">Deliveries 9.0</a></strong> that came out recently. Deliveries 9 helped me track my Apple Watch Series 6 (<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/03/upgrading-from-an-apple-watch-series-4-to-series-6/">read me review here</a>).</p>
<p>As you know, Junecloud, the maker of Deliveries, switched to a subscription model with this release. I don’t really like this model but what can I do? Their pricing is fair and they give to previously paid users a six months break.</p>
<p><a href="https://junecloud.com/press/deliveries/release-notes.html">Version 9</a> brings refined visuals and more details tracking history among other things. The importation workflow has been updated and simplified too. Once delivered, package tracking can be archived forever. iOS 13’s dark mode is now supported but iOS 14 widgets aren’t yet. I think Deliveries is the perfect candidate to support widgets and I can’t wait to see what Junecloud will come up with in that regard.</p>
<p>All in all, as a long time user of Deliveries, I’m ok with this update albeit the switch to the subcription model. If it get’s more frequent feature additions, I’m ok with it, I guess.</p>

They rarely have anything to do with the content of the event itself except maybe with the iPad with Retina Display invite a few years ago. Remember the finger on the screen?</p>
<p>Besides the obvious, an iPhone 12 line up announcement, what&rsquo;s in store? AirTags? Updated Apple TV with Apple&rsquo;s own game controller? HomePod mini? Don&rsquo;t expect Apple Silicon Macs until November. I don&rsquo;t expect Apple to talk about these next week. Apple Silicon Macs need  their own stage time in their own event.</p>
<p>Funny is the fact that iOS 14.1 is held back by Apple to fit this event. Probably contains a lot of hints of what is coming down the line.</p>
<p>The year 2020 can be an exciting one after all. I guess.</p>

I don&rsquo;t care what he would have done differently. It&rsquo;s no longer relevant as we need to keep looking forward, something he always did.
But I still miss him dearly.</p>

More system memory? Mmm not really. Maybe. Maybe not. 🙂
Better screen? Is it even possible? 😬
Longer battery life? Nope. 🙄
Better speakers? Nah. 🥱

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m thinking way too much about widgets these days, thanks to iOS 14 most prominent new feature. I&rsquo;m still reflecting on the possible reasons why the full widgets experience is not available on iPadOS 14. That being said, <a href="https://micro.blog/mattbirchler">@mattbirchler</a> this week came out with an <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/concept-proper-widget-support-on-the-ipad/">interesting and informative video</a> showing how Apple could possibly enable the full widgets experience. This morning, still thinking about this concept, I realized something: <strong>Apple doesn&rsquo;t need to keep the today view support on the iPad in order to enable the full widgets experience</strong>.</p>
<p>I would argue that, in fact, Apple should get rid of the today view that came from the iPhone. One of the reason for this is how bad scrolling the today view works when you have a few widgets stacks; if you don&rsquo;t pay attention on where you put your finger to scroll this view, you actually end up scrolling through the stack itself instead of scrolling the whole view. That&rsquo;s not a good experience. The other reason is the iPad screen canvas makes it easy to rebuild the side view just by using the right widgets. No need to have scrolling.</p>
<p>I think Apple will eventually come up with an iPad-specific version of the widgets experience but not with the iPadOS 14 releases streak. And that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>

			 <p>Learned something really cool today. A few weeks ago I published my review of the well known router, the Unify Dream Machine (available <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/06/21/replacing-an-airport-extreme-with-unifi-dream-machine/">here</a>). The context of this review was the fact that this new router was replacing my aging Apple AirPort. One of the reasons why I chose this device was because of its external look and finish as well as its superb management app.</p>
<p>One of the founder of Ubiquiti is an ex-Apple employee according to this 9to5Mac <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/27/ubiquiti/">article</a>: “<em>an ex-Apple employee went on to found a company that currently sells enterprise networking gear. Robert Pera, the founder of Ubiquiti, Incworked for Apple in the early 2000s as a Wi-Fi engineer.</em>”. Woah. It does explain a few things. This article is well worth your time.</p>

			 <p>I really like what I&rsquo;m seeing here on macOS. Only request is the default view of a New Post window should show the Title and Categories by default. On the web, the improvements are massive. I&rsquo;m surprised the Bookmarking feature is available in a new Premium tier only. I want this feature but not the others (podcasting, richer media support). I&rsquo;ll give it a try <a href="https://www.manton.org/2020/09/29/for-the-microblog.html">while it is free</a> and I&rsquo;ll see. On iOS and iPadOS, the workflow of selecting a photo from the library is still broken, otherwise, I love the changes. There seems to be speed improvements too. In other words, it is snappier!</p>
<p>All in all, I like where Micro.blog is going with these updates.</p>

There is a lot of untapped potential and frustrating design choices. <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/widgetsmith/id1523682319">Widgetsmith</a></strong> is having a moment right now but looks like a work-in-progress to me. It is a great idea but it can be tricky to configure and is not fully intuitive. There is so many more data sources the developer could add. And tell me how I would pay to get weather data in Widgetsmith while I can get it all for free with other apps. The added value of Widgetsmith lies in its configurability, not the fact that you can add weather as a source.</p>

<p>Now,  thanks to widgets support in iOS 14, I&rsquo;m even less satisfied with my iPhone home screen arrangement. I think it&rsquo;s worse than on my Apple Watch. Widgets, when I find one that is <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/09/16/on-developers-questionable.html">perfectly designed and really useful</a>, lack some flexibility.

			 <p>After installing Safari 14 on macOS Catalina, I went on <strong>Apple.com</strong> to see what trackers would be reported. Unsurprisingly, Apple doesn’t use any trackers. Now, the big question: do you believe Apple doesn&rsquo;t track its main website usage?</p>

			 <p>There is something fundamentally wrong with the way iOS 14 widgets are being implemented by many developers. Here is a simple example. The popular Reddit client, Apollo, introduced widgets support, see the following picture. Now, how can a widget with two posts can be useful if you are following many subreddits with dozens of new posts each day? What is the point in doing that?</p>

			 <p>Look, look closely at this leadership page from Apple. Now, ask yourself, who is directing the product directions part? Who says “no, we won&rsquo;t do that!” or “come back when it is done!” or “Yes, that&rsquo;s the direction we will go!”? It used to be Jony Ive and before, Steve Jobs. But, now? How is it possible that someone in charge of “products design” is not on the leadership page? For a company like Apple, it is deeply troubling.</p>

I&rsquo;m kind of frustrated by the non-chronological timeline. It&rsquo;s exhausting. I want to focus on a clean UI providing me a clear view on my timeline. That is all.</p>

It&rsquo;s not about the Mac. It&rsquo;s not about the Apple Silicon. It&rsquo;s about the iPad and the watch. A weird combinaison if you ask me. These updated iPad should be launched with a press release IMHO but Apple needs some stuff to fill the event schedule I guess.</p>

			 <p>Following the #<strong>AppleEvent</strong> announcement yesterday, I saw many comments about a possible schedule of events this fall. Many of them are putting the release of the Apple Silicon Mac in October.</p>
<p>There is no way this is going to happen that early. macOS Big Sur is still at Beta 3. Developers are hard at work adding support for widgets and other iOS 14 stuff. I would expect iOS 14 to be released at the end of September. iOS 14.1 will come out in beta at the beginning of October in order to support the new iPhone shipping later in October.</p>
<p>Now back to the Mac. I expect Big Sur to be released at the very end of October if not November. The actual Apple Silicon Mac will probably be announced at a different moment than the iPhone. Apple doesn&rsquo;t like to mixed up things in their keynote. The actual shipping date could be at the very end of the year, just in time to catch the ramp up of the A14X production rumored to be starting in Q4.</p>
<p>In summary: Apple Silicon Mac to be released late in 2020.</p>

Tuesday 15 September: Event. Friday 18 September: Preorders start. Monday-Tuesday 21-22. September: Reviews drop — Apple Watch on one day, iPad Air on the other. Thursday 24 September: New OSes released via Software Update. Friday 25 September: Products ship to customers and stores.</p>
<p>My guess is that we will get beta 8 this week followed by GM next week. Even if there is another beta after that (beta 9), this would be the shortest beta cycle for any major iOS release.

			 <p><strong>Major issue affecting Adobe Lightroom CC users at version 5.4</strong>: the cloud-based photo procesing software. Users affected by the bug lost portion or all their photo library (I&rsquo;m not one of those, thanks god!). According to an Adobe statement:
<em>We know that some customers have photos and presets that are not recoverable. We sincerely apologize to any customers who have been affected by this issue.</em></p>
<p>Ouch. In other words: Adobe says: fuck you. That&rsquo;s the price of cloud-based storage services (on top of the monthly payment). No service is immute to this. We should be pressuring companies like Adobe, Apple, etc. to stop this non-sense.

			 <p>Great reviews on the latest iMac update. As a serious amateur photographer, the thing that stands out to me is the new nano glass option. At 500$ it is not cheap but reviewers are liking it a lot. Could this option eventually come to the iPad Pro? Or the iPhone? I would pay a premium for this on the iPad Pro.</p>
<p>Now, why the 21.5” iMac has not been updated is a mystery to me. I currently own a max-out 2017 21.5” iMac. The size of this machine is better for me, but I would prefer a 24”. Could this mean the lower size iMac will be the first desktop to receive the Apple Silicon treatment as well a the long overdue redesign? I think so.</p>

<p>Let me be clear: wrong place, too small, text overlapping, not a real button.</p>
<p>Come on, Apple!</p>

			 <p>Very valid complaint from Dieter Bohn of The Verge on Apple’s implementation of widgets management on iPhone. Two different user interfaces for basically the same objective. I prefer the look of the new design, but I understand the previous one is still there for compability purposes.</p>
<p>iOS 14 Beta 3 brings back the « Edit » button at the (very inconvenient place) bottom of the list. Hitting the button brings you back unexpectedly to the top of the widgets list. Going back down the list and you’ll find a “Customize” button. Really? Also, tapping and holding on old widgets doesn’t invoke edit mode. Not very consistent. I should probably fill a feedback report and send it to Apple.</p>
<p>I do think this is a transitional design. Transitions are rarely pleasant.</p>

			 <p>On Apple&rsquo;s 30% cut. Again.</p>
<p>We all know where this all goes. Yesterday it was a deal. Today, 30% is way too much. So, let’s fight and try to force Apple to set the cut to 20%. No, 15%. That is way better, right? A few years down the road, a well known developer comes out and complain about 15% being way too much of a cut. Poor guy. Let&rsquo;s start a fight and bring that down. Apple respond and set it to 10% because they are forced to. And the story continues.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face the reality. We don&rsquo;t like to pay for something. We want it all. We know the price of everything but the value of nothing. How do you think China came to be so powerful? How do you think Amazon or Costco is sucking air from small local businesses in our communities? Why do you think our life is full of shitty ads are everywhere? Why do you think we are the product of Google, Facebook? Because we don&rsquo;t like to pay for something, anything. We want it all free.</p>
<p>There is a pattern. There is a race for the bottom of everything. And I don&rsquo;t agree in Brent’s views on what would happen if Apple lowers their demand from developers. I certainly don&rsquo;t believe developers would lower the price of their apps.</p>
<p>Remember what capitalism is all about?</p>
<p>Change my mind.</p>

			 <p>iPadOS 15 concept imagined by <strong>Parker Ortolani</strong> certainly looks interesting. I&rsquo;m not sure about some ideas put forward but it certainly shows how the iPad is still held back with iPadOS 14. The lack of flexibility in widgets placement is, put mildly, baffling. I love those widgets on my iPhone but the lack of space forces us to create tons of pages. And the problem will only get worst this fall after developers start adding widget support in their apps. It will be crazy. #iPadOS14 #apple</p>

			 <p>Good insights by Federico Viticci of MacStories about iPadOS 14. One theme stands out: with iPadOS 14, Apple is no longer taking it’s inspiration from the iPhone but from macOS to push the iPad in its very distinct path.</p>
<p>Exhibit A: the Sidebar in applications like Music, Photos, Files.
Exhibit B: the redesigned Search bar.</p>
<p>Still to be improved, though: multitasking. Next year.</p>

			 <p>I’m one of those who was thinking discreet GPU would provide much better performance. When watching Apple’s transition to Apple Silicon, I asked myself about discreet GPU options in future Macs. This article goes on to report that not only integrated GPU (thanks to SoC) will be faster, it could be easier to support and help Apple reduce costs. Apple never offered discreet GPU in iPad Pro. Why would it be different with Apple Silicon-based Mac? Will future Mac support external GPU? Probably but performance gain will be marginal.</p>

			 <p>Excellent <strong>visual comparison between macOS Catalina and Big Sur</strong> (see link below). Here are a few observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big Sur design is a step back in clrity in many areas. Ex.: Icons and segmented controls in top portion of windows.</li>
<li>More padding around items lists. I&rsquo;m not sure why. I prefer Catalina&rsquo;s version.</li>
<li>Dark Mode is slightly better looking in Big Sur.</li>
<li>Battery panel in Settings is horrible.</li>
<li>Gone are popup alerts at the top of windows, they now look to be centered within window content and movable. Catalina is better.</li>
<li>Menu bar is translucide. Catalina is better too.</li>
<li>Safari is much better looking in Big Sur.</li>
<li>Notes is much improved in Big Sur.</li>
<li>Big Sur icons shapre are much more uniform. Advantage to Big Sur here.</li>
<li>Big Sur Side Bars in many apps like Maps is better looking too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who wins? Well, the jury is still out.</p>

			 <p>Which Mac will transition first to Apple Silicon? Will Apple start with the desktop or the portables? That is the question. I would say, the desktop, but&hellip;</p>
<p>On the first Mac to be converted to ARM: <strong>my bet goes on the Mac mini</strong>, a lower volume, utility orientated machine for the Mac enthusiasts. Next, the iMac redesign where any perf discrepancies with the MacBook is more easily explanable (desktop versus laptop, you know). But&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;my confidence level in this theory will be negatively impacted by the actual release of a rumoured redesigned iMac but with an Intel processor instead. Rumors are circulating about a published benchmark with a 10 cores Intel CPU in a new iMac design. If Apple did release this machine, it would send a clear message: they will continue to support Intel machines for a long time. But&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;launching an iMac redesign with an Apple Silicon inside would make a much  better marketing story: something like a powerful Apple Silicon powering a brand new design with unique features (fan-less design, FaceID, or even&hellip; touch input support?). But&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;I concede the fact that price/watt ratio is much more useful and lends much more practical advantages on a portable product than on the desktop where space and energy are less constrained which puts some doubts on my take.</p>
<p>Finally, about the Mac Pro conversion to ARM. My gut feeling is that it will be the last to be converted&hellip; with A16 CPU? Who knows.</p>
<p>PS: I would expect Apple to re-introduce their illuminated logo on the MacBook. A sign of Apple’s enthusiast returning to the Mac.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about the limited support of widgets in iPadOS 14. While waiting for an answer from Craig Federighi (see previous posts), I think I know why. The way Apple introduced widgets in iPadOS 13 kind of put themselves in a “bad design choice” corner.</p>
<p>Take an iPad with iPadOS 13 in landscape orientation with widgets showing on the left, now look what happens when rotating the iPad in portrait mode. See? Imagine widgets all over the home screen. How could the iPad handle this orientation change gracefully? You tell me.</p>

			 <p>Today, it will be interesting to see how Apple is positioning its move from Intel to ARM.</p>
<p>To me, one thing is clear: this could be another game changer move. Apple has proven many times in the past that you don&rsquo;t need to own a market (PC sales) to create new inflection points on its trajectory. Remember when Apple legitimize the use of the USB ports in its original iMac? Now, they could legitimize the use of ARM on traditional computers.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>From <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/06/20/one_advantage_of_the_app_store_thats_gon">Brent Simmons</a>:</p>
<p><em>The best part of the App Store, years ago, from this developer’s point of view, was that it was easy to charge money for an app. No need to set up a system — just choose the price, and Apple takes care of everything. So easy!</em></p>
<p>And</p>
<p><em>for many developers, the very best thing about the App Store — the thing that actually helped their business — is gone.</em></p>
<p>And this</p>
<p><em>I can’t reconcile in my mind the tension between Apple as the think different company, the pirates, the rebels, the company at the intersection of tech and liberal arts — and Apple the company that runs this legalistic, nitpicky, greedy, inhuman, happy-face Kafka App Store.</em></p>
<p>And finally this</p>
<p><em>If I could distribute my iOS app outside of the App Store, I would. I’d switch in a heartbeat. Even though it’s free and money isn’t my issue. It would make my work as an app maker easier.</em></p>
<p>Ouch. Coming this guy, it means a lot.</p>
<p>WWDC20 already has a special feel to it, even before the start&hellip; not only because it is digital only, but also because I feel (many) developers are simpky fed up with the Apple way.</p>

			 <p>I’m not very optimistic on the outcome of the “HEY vs Apple” battle. Both, in their own ways, are arrogant, blinkered and calling out each other. Each will lose their face with a concession, even if it’s small. Big egos against each other here.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, potential users on iOS will suffer from the lack of much needed app updates. This could be a deal breaker for many users like me. HEY is losing, Apple is losing, users are losing.</p>

			 <p>It is fun to compare <strong>HEY</strong> and <strong>Micro.blog</strong>. They both depend on open web standards on the <strong>backend</strong>. HEY depends on SMTP while Micro.blog depends on HTTPS/HTML. HEY wants to re-invent the end-user experience while Micro.blog provides a pretty much generic end-user experience. By turning the end-user experience upside down, HEY doesn&rsquo;t rely on IMAP. This is where some people turns their back to HEY (there may be other reasons, though).</p>

This is a complete mess and I don’t know how Apple will get out of this shit. If goes far beyond the 30% commission.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Interesting piece (see link below) about software quality going down in a world where hardware quality is culminating to levels never seen before. Here are a few of my thoughts on this subject.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, I think the law of entropy is much more active in software than in hardware. We are actually witnessing the slow disorganization of software (both in features &amp; code), hence the quality goes down with it.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, we are also witnessing the (good and bad) consequences of unsustainable complexity of a growing software ecosystem. The good is the added value of combining things together in order to make the whole greater than the sum of its part. Apple is good at this. The bad is the difficulty to make it all work.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, take the Finder in macOS. How many revisions has been done on this essential piece of software and by how many generations and teams of developers? How one company make sure, from one generation to the other, the knowledge about how the Finder is coded doesn&rsquo;t get diluted? I see this as an important challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, the marriage of hardware with software, the complete integration of the stack that Apple is able to achieve because they nearly own all the pieces pose big challenges.   There are so many combinaisons to test and optimize. I can see many bugs falling between the cracks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not excusing Apple for the fact that their software quality is going down. They must slowdown and consolidate their software assets. In a maturing world, I would expect they do just that.</p>

			 <p>Seems like <strong>ARM-based Macs</strong> is a go for this year’s WWDC. The news comes from a source that I don’t like (remember the “Big Hack Story”?) so I’m not sharing the link. In summary: a bit faster CPU, much faster on graphics, ML processing unit, low power hence cooler system, new design enabler. Long transition time expected. Unknown is how are third-parties will transition their apps. Will a DEV kit be made available.</p>

<p>Now, look at the iPad with the just introduced pointer support. It’s exactly that, hovering on buttons make the pointer morph into the button’s shape. Fascinating.</p>

			 <p>When I go for a walk my mostly empty city, thanks to the long lasting confinement, I see many lines in front of different grocery stores. These are unfamiliar scenes for us.</p>
<p>It reminds me of when I was a young child. It was at the height of the cold war. At that time, medias were portraying communism as the bad guys. I cannot count how many times I saw in the news, scenes from USSR of people waiting in front of grocery stores to get a few vegetables and bread. It was in the seventies. And we were kind of laughing at them and their failed society. And here we are. Different cause for sure but mostly same effects.</p>

			 <p>Thanks Apple but this is not an <strong>iPhone SE</strong>. Ask every previous iPhone SE owners and they will confirm. To call it an iPhone SE, you have to change one thing: its size. You are playing with words here. it is an <strong>iPhone 9</strong> (looking at <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/04/15/compared-iphone-8-versus-iphone-se">this</a> is enough to be convinced).

			 <p>Here is something that bugs me with “<strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>” or with services that are supporting this feature.</p>
<p>The easy and fun part is when you sign up as a new user of a service supporting “<strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>”. But what if I’m an already signed up user for many years then I want to switch to “<strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>” without creating a new account? Some service are providing a way to link an Apple ID in order to enable “<strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>”. But it is the minority. WordPress.com is such an example.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>

Just listen to press conferences, one after the other. It is disgusting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if in recent days I&rsquo;m calling out more things about politics, The Clown in Chief and the US. I should be writing about Apple, photography my dear passions.

			 <p>I have a dear friend living in Denver, Co. He has a PhD in human comm. He is brilliant. But, he doesn&rsquo;t understand all the fuss about <strong>COVID-19</strong>. For him, shutting down everything is over reacting. I tried to explain the curve, the pressure on health care system, etc. He thinks the flu is worst and yet we don&rsquo;t shut down the country. I said yes and no.</p>
<p><strong>We shouldn&rsquo;t trust current numbers in the US because they are way undervaluated.</strong> There is no reason to think the US population will be affected differently than other population in other countries without containment. They will. And it will be much worst becaue there is a lack of major containment as of this writing. The US is a the beginning of the curve. The exponential curve. This will be ugly. Remember: a single day of &ldquo;wait-and-see&rdquo; does make a big dfference and we have the numbers and the experience of other countries to prove it.</p>

			 <p>Another <strong>iPadOS multitasking concept</strong> appeared on Twitter. First, this is an intersting starting point to redo multitasking on the iPad. Very simple gesture: single tap as it should be. My guess is that developers wouldn&rsquo;t need to update their app in order to support this new model. It does fix the problem of finding the second app to bring in. Second, how the hell do they make these animations? How do we bring this to Apple&rsquo;s attention?

			 <p>I expect Apple to go ahead with this, allowing the users to set a default browser or mail client on iOS. Changing defaults is part of a modern OS and this would be, in my opinion, another step towards the upcoming ARM-based Macs running iPadOS. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/02/20/bloomberg-apple-discussing-allowing-iphone-users-to-set-third-party-web-browsers-and-email-apps-as-defaults-native-spotify-on-homepod/">9to5mac.com/2020/02/2&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>Apple should introduce another type of subscription: pay-per-use. Pricing would be based on the <strong>time spent on-screen</strong>, down to a second resolution. Pricing would be based on dime fractions, payable on demand, monthly or yearly. Exemple: five minutes of an app usage @ $ 0.00001 would cost 1.08 yearly. That is an extreme example for sure.

I know we can sometimes infer the date from the URL but to me it isn&rsquo;t the right way to do it.</p>
<p>A content creators, If we suspect content we publish will age well, let&rsquo;s put a publishing date on it! If we do think this is ephemeral stuff, a publishing date helps put some context for the content. Makes sense?</p>

			 <p>When so many apps are available for a specific task, choosing one can be a nightmare. Recently, my focus was to select a new calendar app following the release of Fantastical update. I finally settled on the one that I use for a few years now: Calendar 5. The same is happening right now with RSS readers. But this time, I’’m switching from the excellent Reeder app to News Explorer. The latter is not perfect but from a functional point of view, it is an improvement. More on this soon.</p>

			 <p>My goal as a blogger is to get people read my stuff. RSS feeds are a way to help users access my content. Trying to be protective is counterproductive for me. The idea is to remove friction to the users. If they want to read via Reeder for example, why not! On that note, If a website doesn’t provide an RSS feed, which is sad, I’m let interested to stay in touch.
