			 <p>I&rsquo;m still digesting everything we heard and saw today. Like someone wrote today: what was that? I already read good (and dumb) reactions here and there, from which I&rsquo;m trying to stay away, just to focus and maybe get my analysis and perspective one of my own. That&rsquo;s not easy; it&rsquo;s so noisy out there right now. Stay tuned for later this week.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs Apple keynote day, and it is exciting but also stressful! Here are last-minute questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will the headset pricing be announced today?</li>
<li>Will the headset be like the Apple Watch and be running apps, or will it be more like CarPlay, with some additional viewport from the iPhone? Or a combination?</li>
<li>Is the headset unveiled with a ‚Äúone more thing‚Äù segment?</li>
<li>When the iPad was announced, Steve Jobs spent some time explaining its relative position within the use cases spectrum of our computing devices. Where does the headset fit?</li>
<li>Will the headset announcement overshadow Apple‚Äôs timid foray into generative AI?</li>
<li>Is Xcode finally coming to the iPad?</li>
<li>Can we infer something about the rumors setting the price 1999$ when we compare that to the AirPods Max price?</li>
<li>Tim Cook‚Äôs air time has decreased in recent events, is the trend continuing today?</li>
<li>Can we expect another meme moment from <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/leadership/craig-federighi/">Craig Federighi</a>?</li>
<li>Who‚Äôs going to present the headset? <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/leadership/jeff-williams/">Jeff Williams</a>, just like for the Apple Watch Ultra?</li>
<li>Can any of the announcements today affect my Apple hardware upgrade plan?</li>
</ul>
<p>For someone who‚Äôs not interested in the headset, I have far too many questions about it. I‚Äôll return to this post once the event is complete to fill in the answers!</p>

			 <p>üëâüèª This is <strong>WWDC day</strong>! Here are some informative tidbits. Two weeks ago, I set up a fake meeting in my work calendar for the entire afternoon (EST time here). I‚Äôll be out of the office for the whole afternoon. I‚Äôve been doing that for more than ten years. It worked 9 out of 10 times. I should be good to go today.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll watch the keynote from within Safari to take screenshots (with the TV app, screenshots don‚Äôt work ü§î). Then, using a configured button on my <strong>StreamDeck</strong> mini, I‚Äôll take the screenshots that will be saved and moved to my <strong>Synology</strong> NAS automatically; thanks to <strong>Hazel</strong>. The excellent Mastodon client, <strong>Ivory</strong>, will be running too side-by-side so that I can see reactions coming in. Sadly, feed streaming is not yet a thing on Mastodon, apparently.</p>
<p>My expectations are relatively low for all the tech announcements but high for the keynote production value and quality.</p>

I&rsquo;m unsure if I&rsquo;ll go on <strong>Mastodon</strong> or <strong>Bluesky</strong> to read the room temperature. I&rsquo;ll see.

			 <p>Here‚Äôs a short ‚Äúlife at the office‚Äù story. Our VP of sales never stops bragging about how <strong>ChatGPT</strong> is cool and how it works for him for many use cases. I‚Äôm uncomfortable with his stance on ChatGPT &amp; generative AI in general. I think about it each time he sends an email that was obviously created with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Why is it a problem for me? Who am I to judge him and his ‚Äúnew way of working‚Äù? I think I have found the root cause.</p>
<p>First, it‚Äôs not the results of his work. It‚Äôs the work of something else. He takes something ‚Äúas is‚Äù without adding any value, any personal opinion, or a personal twist. Second, the fundamental problem is that he works in IT but is not a tech guy. He is a salesperson. He‚Äôs the type of guy who surfs on buzzwords a lot. Using ChatGPT makes him circumvent his lack of confidence because of a lack of IT knowledge and culture. He probably feels better and more ‚Äúinto the game‚Äù like most of my other colleagues, who studied computer science before getting to work in IT.</p>
<p>How many more people lack my colleague do the same, for the same reason?</p>

			 <p>For my next trip, I will bring my <strong>Nikon D750</strong> and my <strong>iPhone 13 Pro</strong> (of course!), and my 2018 11-inch <strong>iPad Pro</strong>. How am I going to process my images? Will I continue using <strong>Lightroom</strong> for images from my Nikon? I usually use the iPad to import my photos into the Lightroom catalogue. What about pictures on my iPhone, which should be mostly in RAW format and shot with <strong>Halide</strong>? I like <strong>Photomator</strong> a lot; it is nicer than Lr and more approachable too. However, using Photomator to process images from my Nikon poses a challenge in file management. I‚Äôll need to import the .NEF files from my SD card into my iPad in an <strong>iCloud Drive</strong> folder so I can work on imported files from any device (iPad, MacBook Air or iPhone). I prefer using iCloud Photos Library instead of managing files manually. I guess this will be this combo: Photomator + Halide for my ‚Äúshot on iPhone‚Äù images!</p>
<p>Just writing this blog post made things a little bit less fuzzy. I‚Äôll take any suggestions!</p>

			 <p><img src="https://numericcitizen-test.micro.blog/uploads/2023/a24a99b754.png" alt="Thumbnails of my produced YouTube videos" title="Thumbnails of my produced YouTube videos"></p>
<p>A year ago, I shared my first YouTube video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos">my YouTube channel</a>. My initial goal was to share videos about using <strong>Craft</strong>, but later came videos about using <strong>Micro.blog</strong>. Here are some notable facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>52 videos about Craft were produced;</li>
<li>5 videos about Micro.blog were produced;</li>
<li>All videos totalling more than 13.5 hours of watch time;</li>
<li>My YouTube channel has 813 subscribers as of now;</li>
<li>Two subscribers gave me money as a sign of appreciation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel I‚Äôm now on par with all the things I wanted to talk about regarding Craft. Future Craft videos will touch on new features and tweaked workflow. I still have much work to do for Micro.blog video series, though.</p>
<p>At the initial pace of new subscribers, I set the goal of hitting a thousand subscribers in the first year, but I‚Äôm sad to report that I won‚Äôt make it. The pace of new subscribers has slowed quite a bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen-test.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f56e1ad564.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This video production journey is full of learning and lessons. Over time, I settled on a production style I‚Äôm happy with. I finally found a way to get better sound quality. I recently added iA Presenter to get cue cards showing on my screen while recording (read ‚Äú<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/ia-presenter-a-different-clever-take-at-presentation-software/">iA Presenter ‚Äî A Different &amp; Clever Take at Presentation Software</a>‚Äù). My workflow is stable now and is supported by <a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/youtube-video-production-template">this Craft template</a> (you can download and use it if you are a Craft user, BTW). Finally, I started using <strong>Play.app</strong> to gather all my video links in one place. This provides a quick way to refer to past videos whenever needed.</p>
<p>I also produced videos about other apps like <strong>Capacities</strong>, <strong>Inoreader</strong> and <strong>Anybox</strong>. Some of these videos take the form of a 60 minutes session with the app as a first-time user. It‚Äôs fun as there is no script supporting those experiences.</p>
<p>Today, I will record a video about the WWDC 23 conference. The video will complement my recently published <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/apples-wwdc-2023-keynote-thoughts-before-the-news-flood/">article</a> on the same subject. It will be my first foray into tech news and commentary. I‚Äôm not planning to do many of these, but WWDC is significant and needs some of my production time attention.</p>

			 <p>So, apparently, just like Twitter, Reddit is entering into a &ldquo;kill-third-party-apps&rdquo; by charging an enormous amount of money to use their APIs. It looks like it. Apollo isn&rsquo;t happy, and for good reasons. Unless there was a calculation error from the makers of Apollo, it just makes no sense for them to continue. Maybe Reddit made some calculation errors, too. Perhaps they fail to read the room&rsquo;s temperature. But maybe they are entitled, to some degree, I guess, to charge for their APIs, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to make a parallel with Apple&rsquo;s dreaded 15%-30% App Store commission. Is Apple&rsquo;s stance on its App Store different from Reddit&rsquo;s stance on its APIs? Is charging a commission to be on the App Store and take advantage of all Apple&rsquo;s technology to get a chance to be distributed on hundreds of millions of iPhones similar to consuming a platform APIs? If not, what is different, actually? Is free API usage a dead end in today&rsquo;s world? There are whole business models built around APIs these days. API speaks intellectual property in my book. Only companies with business models supported by massive ad distribution or expansive paid subscriptions can think of thriving by giving away their API access. It will be interesting to see how Reddit is reacting to third-party developers' pushback.</p>
<p>Oh, and if they actually kill the third-party Reddit client ecosystem, unlike Twitter, Reddit platform alternatives are not obvious to me.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s time to remember: there is no such thing as a free lunch.</p>
