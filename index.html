<p>We went to the movies yesterday night. The first time in two years. ‚ÄúNo Time To Die‚Äù was good. As much as other types of business has evolved in this time frame, buying tickets, bad quality lighting, flaky sound systems are still part of my usual subpar experience at the movies. No wonder why this is a dying business.</p>

<p>Matt Bircher on the lack of ‚ÄúLike‚Äù on Glass:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is a terrible idea and I&rsquo;m in the minority here, but I really do think that I would enjoy the app more if I was able to give lower-friction reactions to people&rsquo;s photos. I still like Glass quite a bit, and I browse it everyday, but I do often feel like I don&rsquo;t have the energy to comment on all the photos I like, and that&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lee Peterson‚Äôs take on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not having follower counts and likes is a great way to stop the comparison to others and help to reduce the stress of feeling bad about myself for not making engaging content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs not an easy thing to consider. Matt‚Äôs point of view also echos mine. If Glass added likes, does that put them on the path of Instagram, ads, and algorithm-based feed? I don‚Äôt think so. Glass is a paid service. That‚Äôs the key.</p>

<p>What if the decision of enabling likes was delegated to the photographer posting photos? I would enable it, Matt probably would too, but not Lee. The same goes for seeing and showing the followers count on the profile page. What if those decisions were put in the hands of the content creator? Let the platform have it builtin and the content creator decide what to do with it. Twitter‚Äôs Revue offers such a feature of showing the subscribers count on the Revue profile page. I like it, and <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/apple_observer">it is enabled</a>, even though I only have two subscribers.</p>

<p>On Micro.blog, the situation is pretty much the same. We don‚Äôt get likes to our posts, we don‚Äôt get to see how many followers we‚Äôve got. I made requests to the guy behind Micro.blog for the ability to see the followers count on Micro.blog without much success. This data could be made private, and we could enable to show it on our profile page.</p>

<p>Why is the platform the only one making those decisions? Let the content creators decide. You can find me on Glass under the Numericcitizen moniker, here is <a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen/177p1t0W8JcEpFmwWuORyw">one of my shared photo</a>.</p>

         	<p>Google, recently on Twitter, announcing their adoption of Apple‚Äôs UIKit design language instead of using their Material design:</p>

<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/f860b2806b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúDoes a switch really need to be built custom in alignment with a generic design system? Or might it be sufficient to simply use the system solution and move on?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don‚Äôt buy Google‚Äôs explanation. Google is trying to say that UIKit wasn‚Äôt good enough for them, so they went their own way. Bullshit. The other way to look at this: building native apps is a better way to go than trying to build apps on unifying frameworks.</p>

<p>Today, Vanmoof announced their latest e-bike, the Vanmoof V model. The announcement video, reminiscent of Apple‚Äôs product reveals, is light on details. The singular design, in white, is both intriguing and looks heavy on the look. Some specs are impressive, on paper. But, there is something absolutely troubling: the V model is going to ship near the end of 2022. Yep, in more than a year. What is going on here? What this premature announcement could mean for Vanmoof? Well, obviously they are trying to gain mind share among potential e-bike buyers, and they are afraid to lose market share.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôll be developing the VanMoof V over the upcoming year, and will keep you updated with news and features as the bike comes to life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you imagine if Apple were to announce a new flagship product iteration, the next iPhone, more than a year in advance? I wonder if Vanmoof is aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect">Osborne effect</a>. üßê</p>

         	<p>Been thinking about Notion recently. Before using Craft, I was a fan of Notion. I spent a few moments today on Notion to make some cleanup. I think I‚Äôm still a fan. Craft feels better for me as a writer tool. Yet, Notion is features rich. They keep improving it. I don‚Äôt know  if they do it at a faster pace than Craft. They are certainly more mature. The team behind Craft being smaller, they don‚Äôt have the same resources. Many features are missing. But there is something to it that is missing in Notion. Craft being native on the Mac (it‚Äôs a Catalyst app), it makes a big difference. Anyway, I‚Äôll keep an eye on Notion. Who knows if I‚Äôll come back.</p>

<p>After many weeks of trying, I finally sold my 2017 21.5 inches iMac. Even though Apple is currently selling M1 iMac at a competitive price, I thought that it would be easier to get rid of my Mac. It was a maxed out configuration, which helped me ask for a higher than usual price compared to other sellers. Yet, it wasn‚Äôt easy. As you might guess, I‚Äôm not the only one trying to sell an Intel-based iMac.</p>

<p>The next device put on sale was my iPhone 11 Pro with 256 GB of storage. One week before the officiel launch of the iPhone 13 Pro, I put up my older iPhone for sale. I got quite a few people interested in it, but the problem was the price they were willing to offer. It was way under my asking price, closer to what Apple is offering as a trade-in value. I think this is part of the problem. Many people are looking to get rid of their older devices to help pay for the new one, but potential buyers are comparing to what Apple is offering, which shouldn‚Äôt be used to fix the value of the second hand iPhone. Apple will refurbish the device or recycle it. This cannot be used as a comparison. After a week of getting my trade-in kit, I decided to return my iPhone instead of bothering to sell it.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/09/01/coming-out-of-a-rabbit-hole-and-buying-two-macbook-air/">I bought my MacBook Air</a> back in August, it came with a free pair of AirPods. I didn‚Äôt need them, so I put them on sale too. That one was easy to sell, though. It took less than half a day to find someone willing to get them.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs true that Apple hardware keep their resale value, but I think it‚Äôs not what it used to be. Apple is no longer the underdog, their devices are everywhere, which puts pressure on pricing.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs I‚Äôd like to see come in Canada is the iPhone upgrade program available in the US. I think I would pay a monthly price to always get the newer iPhone.</p>

<p>This podcast <a href="https://appstories.net/posts/the-ipad-mini-small-wonder">episode</a> from MacStories featuring <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Viticci</a> triggered quite a few reactions. Why? Because of these two sentences in the first moments of the episode talking about the iPad mini:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt want to read/or watch a review by someone who is not a professional reviewer. It wouldn‚Äôt be enjoyable.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep. Viticci said that. In ‚Äú<a href="https://merecivilian.com/the-value-of-a-non-reviewers-perspective/">The value of a non-reviewer‚Äôs perspective</a>‚Äù from <a href="https://twitter.com/MereCivilian">Mere Civilian</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄùI agree, a review from a person who does not write for a living may not be enjoyable. However, I strongly disagree with the first sentence. ‚Äú</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Really? Then, I read <a href="https://ljpuk.net/2021/09/29/im-not-a-professional-but-my-opinion-is-valid-too/">this reaction</a> from Lee Peterson on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄùMacStories posts some great stuff but not everyone wants to read long articles, some like smaller easy to digest articles from independent writers, I like to think I do that here. I get to the point and try to respect my audiences time, does that make my opinion invalid or not enjoyable?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is my response. Viticci comments make him look full of himself. Period. I‚Äôm happy for him if he can live from writing reviews. I would rather read review from real end-users because the point is to get comments and observations from real use case scenarios. Sure, I like reviews from Marques Brownlee because he has well-balanced and critical point of views on a lot of stuff. It also touches the subject of what makes someone a blogger or a writer. If you write constantly, then you are a writer. Are you Shakespeare? Probably not. There is a starting point for everyone. Some will fall along the road, others will thrive. I tend to think of reviews by professionnel reviewers as synthetic reviews, where there is a lot of speed and feed talk. At some point, we want to go beyond that and have comments coming from experience. So, sure, I‚Äôd like to read comments from pilots about the real usefulness of the iPad mini. They are the one who can make a judgment on the subject.</p>

<p>Last year I wrote ‚Äú<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/03/im-not-an-audiophile-but-here-are-my-thoughts-on-apples-airpods-max/" title="I‚Äôm not an audiophile, but here are my thoughts on Apple‚Äôs AirPods Max">I‚Äôm not an audiophile, but here are my thoughts on Apple‚Äôs AirPods Max</a>‚Äù which is not of ‚Äúreview‚Äù but a collection of observations. I concluded with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄùSo, do I like the sound quality of my AirPods Max? Yes. Do they sound better than my Bose QC25? Yes. By a wide margin compared with the price difference with my Bose Q25? No. But, hey, they are wireless, convenient, comfier, have transparency mode, spatial audio and they fit within Apple‚Äôs walled garden.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any value in this? I think so. Should Viticci care? Certainly not. I do have genuine thoughts and opinions, and this is my ultimate right to share them with the world for exactly what they are: <em>thoughts and observations</em>. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

There is a lot to like in this update, like the 3D detailed views in some major cities like San Francisco. These 3D views remind me of SimCity, a game on which I‚Äôve spent countless hours playing. Maps as matured over the years, following the <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/09/16/the-iterative-apple.html">iterative nature of Apple‚Äôs approach</a> to everything they do. Some don‚Äôt like it, others see the value in it. I‚Äôm one of those who think this is the best approach as each iteration helps build the next one with good cumulative experience. Today‚Äôs Maps, nine year later after a rocky start, in 2012, is impressive and as good as other popular alternatives, in my area at least.</p>

<p>Microsoft‚Äôs announcements this week are nothing less than impressive. Microsoft is showing courage. Their Surface are striking. These things will probably be hot as hell (pun intended, thanks to Intel Inside). I‚Äôm hoping users will have a better experience than many of my colleague who had their Surface replaced in the last year because of over heating issues. Stylus On the surface (pun intended) may not work as well as the Apple Pencil on the iPad. Apple is at their best in that regard. Yet, we have to give them credits for what they are doing. They are iterating with more than incremental updates. They try new things. It‚Äôs interesting to see Microsoft aligning itself with Apple strategy: vertical integration (hardware + software: Windows) with a yearly release schedule. Designed for Windows 11. Well done.</p>

<p>Now, looking forward to Apple‚Äôs next announcement: the MacBook Pro ‚Äúredesign‚Äù. Don‚Äôt expect anything close to what Microsoft is doing. But expect Apple to reintroduce the HDMI port and the SD Card reader. According the latest <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/09/22/tim-would-love.html">leaks</a>.</p>

<p>After a long summer of beta releases, today we get to see the final releases of iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Are you feeling as excited as a few years ago at the same time? Personally, even if I think those are great iterative updates, I don‚Äôt. There is less to grab by developers it seems. I‚Äôm not expecting exciting new releases for any of my apps. What about yours?</p>

<p>If you think that this year&rsquo;s updates from Apple are <strong><em>meh</em></strong>, I think, either you didn‚Äôt pay attention during the keynote or you‚Äôre simply bored. You may not like the iterative nature of Apple under Tim Cook, maybe you forgot to remember that the smartphone (and to some degree) the smartwatch are mature products. Since Apple is paying attention to what the majority of people actually care about, improving battery life, adding more storage, keeping prices steady, not having to wait three months to get a new device, stop expecting folding iPhone to prove Apple is still innovating.</p>

<p>There, I said it.</p>

<p>One of <a href="https://marco.org/2021/09/13/future-of-the-app-store">the best recent take</a> on the possible future of the App Store.</p>

<p>Regarding IAP purchases:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most apps will be required to also offer IAP side-by-side with any external methods</p>

<p>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Many games will offer both IAP and external purchases, with the external choice offering a discount, bonus gems, extra loot boxes, or other manipulative tricks to optimize the profitability of casino games for children</p>

<p>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>External purchase methods will evolve to be almost as convenient as IAP</p>

<p>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The payment-fraud doomsday scenarios argued by Apple and many fans mostly won‚Äôt happen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, App Store side-loading and alternative App Stores:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook would soon have apps that bypassed App Review installed on the majority of iPhones in the world.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Without the threat of App Review to keep them in check, Facebook‚Äôs apps would become even more monstrous than they already are.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Alternative app stores would be even worse. Rather than offering individual apps via side-loading, Facebook could offer just one: The Facebook App Store.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Maybe Google would bring the Play Store to iOS and offer a unified SDK to develop a single codebase for iOS and Android, effectively making every app feel like an Android app</p>

<p>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Media conglomerates that own many big-name properties, like Disney, might each have their own app stores for their high-profile apps.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Most developers would probably need to start submitting our apps to multiple app stores, each with its own rules, metadata, technical requirements, capabilities, approval delays, payment processing, stats, crash reports, ads, promotion methods, and user reviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a few words: what a fucking mess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt expect side-loading or alternative app stores to become possible, and I‚Äôm relieved, because that is not a future I want for iOS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm not so sure this won‚Äôt happen, but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt want too. If only Apple could better read the room‚Äôs temperature and budge a tad.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.readwise.io/readwise-reading-app/">recent announcement</a> by Readwise.io:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re now in position to reimagine aspects of the digital reading experience itself, from how you annotate a document, to how you navigate. Readwise as you know it today isn&rsquo;t going anywhere, but this is our future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the new Readwise reading app, not only will these resurfacing and syncing features not go away, they will be enhanced through tight integration into the reading experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is much more to digest on their published essay. They‚Äôve been thinking about this for a while and judging from a few screenshots, their reading app seems compelling and well done. I‚Äôm hoping they will support Safari‚Äôs extensions. RSS feeds will be supported too. Sadly, it will probably be another Electron-based app. We‚Äôll see if this doesn‚Äôt affect too much the experience.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been a subscriber of Readwise.io for a while, but I must admit that I‚Äôm not taking advantage of it as much as I would have liked. It does get synced with my Pocket account, but that‚Äôs about it. Oh, and my saved quotes get resurfaced in my <a href="https://app.mailbrew.com/apple_observer/numeric-citizen-newsletter-x9MmQUXjnEMG">Mailbrew summary newsletter</a>, which is cool.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve subscribed to their private beta testers waiting list and I can‚Äôt wait to try it out. If all goes well and is up to what they say on their blog post, this could entirely replace Pocket for me.</p>

<p>So, you‚Äôve got an e-Bike. Good for you. I‚Äôm jealous. You‚Äôve got an Apple Watch too. Good for you, just like me. Now you want to go for a ride and record this activity with your Apple Watch. Which activity type will you select? Selecting <em>Bike</em> will probably record wrong data as you can move much faster than a regular bike and getting lower than normal heartbeat rate. Should Apple provide another type of biking activity?</p>

<p>I was at the office. A normal day. It was a perfect sunny and more than usual mild September day. Blue sky. Then the news struck. At first, I didn‚Äôt understand what was actually happening. The internet went slow, to the point of becoming unusable. My colleagues started to leave their desks. We all turned to the TV set in the employees cafeteria. It was such a unique accident, we all thought. Then, the second plane, which marked a turning point in our history of modern barbarism. We are still trying to recover from it. I think of this day so often, each time with deception and bitterness because <a href="https://apple.news/AAJ6-Fv7HSzS1jiz13apuSg">we didn‚Äôt learned the right lessons</a>.</p>

<p>Side note: I find the American society fascinating. They seems to treat those who died on 9-11 differently then those who die each year from guns. The latter are more than three times those who died on 9-11. Each year. The US spent close to 6 000 billions dollars on war since 2001. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. How much do they spend on guns to try to fix this problem? Fascinating indeed.</p>

<p>Consider this screenshot of the Medium.app updates streak. It‚Äôs not a joke. At least one update a week for reimagining their app. I used to like Medium but their app, probably a major conduit to their content, is broken on the iPad and it never gets fixed (mainly layout issues).</p>

<p>How are we supposed to take online publishers seriously when for months they let bugs hinder the user experience of‚Ä¶ reading their content? I greatly reduced my use of Medium for reading content, partly because of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to various challenges of COVID-19 and the recent announcement from Apple on their transition away from x86 to Apple Silicon, VMware will no longer pursue hardware certification for the Apple 2019 Mac Pro 7,1 for ESXi.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is sad news and probably not a surprising news. In early 2020, I came close to buy an entry-level Mac Pro in order to build a lab-in-a-box for experimenting different environments and software, all related to my work. I started <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/?s=sddcbox">this thread</a> on my blog about my SDDCbox project, and was nearly ready to make the decision. Somehow, priorities shifted and I dropped my project entirely.</p>

<p>It is one thing to see new apps being non-native to the Mac, <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/08/12/1password-8-mac-early-access-triggers-an-early-exit/">like 1Password 8</a> and maybe the <a href="https://readwise.io/read">upcoming Readwise Reader</a> app, but it is another when a major player like VMware no longer consider the Mac as a viable platform for things like ESXi. Apple‚Äôs transition to its own silicon has obviously something to do with it. The Mac has never been more popular than today, yet, on the software side, I feel there is a ‚Äúmalaise‚Äù.</p>

<p>In recent days or weeks, rumours are rampant on the updated design of the Apple Watch: bigger but flatter screen, boxier design are the main themes, with no new health sensors. I‚Äôm not so sure about the boxy design. It‚Äôs ok for the iPad or the iPhone but for a watch? To me, it could make it less approachable, less jewelry. We‚Äôll see in a few weeks. There is one thing that I‚Äôd like to point out about the Series 7: Apple is not only presumably launching an updated design, <strong>they are creating a new price point</strong>. The bigger screen helps legitimate this. They have been doing this since Tim Cook is CEO.</p>

<p>Now what? How will Apple respond? Will they create a different version of iOS for South Korea? Can they simply appeal this law, if such a thing is possible? How is this going to help other countries and parties to go after Apple&rsquo;s practices? How much time will Apple be given to change its practices? Three months? A year? South Korea is probably a small market for Apple compared to other places in the world, but this new law seems like a tsunami in the making.</p>

         	<p>Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/18/ios-15-safari-beta-6">writing</a> about how Apple mostly fixed Safari 15 on iPhone with beta 6 (emphasis is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The unusual part is that we got to see Apple‚Äôs design process play out in public. The Safari team has been kept busy this summer. (There has to be one hell of backstory here, right?)</strong> There was a certain pessimism amongst some who perceived the problems with the original iOS 15 Safari design, simply because Apple seldom makes drastic UI changes between their unveiling at WWDC in June, and when they officially ship in the fall. But seldom isn‚Äôt never.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôd love to read the behind-the-scene-story about this ‚Äúin public‚Äù design process that we all witnessed. The Safari team surely scrambled to fix the design issues between beta 1 and beta 6‚Ä¶ or was just all planned in advance? I bet on the former. The whole saga was unusual for Apple. They look less confident from a design perspective.</p>

<p>I love Safari 15 in beta 6. They nailed it, and it is an improvement compared to the pre-iOS 15 implementation.</p>

<p>iOS 15 beta 6 is out and Apple is making great progress with Safari on iPhone. For me, they finally hit the right notes. I think that‚Äôs the design they should have included since day one of iOS 15. Yet, I find it funny to see Apple put a new option in settings for those who prefer the pre-iOS 15 release. I guess it‚Äôs another case of ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt decide which design is the best, just add another option in Settings so the user decide.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
<p>macOS Big Sur did a great job of refining the Mac desktop, but it didn‚Äôt fundamentally change any of its behavior. We‚Äôd like to see that change with the next version of macOS. With Monterey being mostly full of small refinements rather than big ideas, we‚Äôd expect Mammoth to be a monstrous release.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm using one of his screen design that pertains to widgets improvements. I recently <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/08/11/what-widgets-on-macos-big-sur-should-have-been/">wrote</a> about those and Apple‚Äôs sad design decision to keep them in the notifications center for Big and Monterey. I think Ortolani‚Äôs design is interesting and plausible. Freedom of placement certainly makes the experience more satisfying. It‚Äôs so true they liberated widgets on iPad with iPadOS 15.</p>

<p>There is so much work going into these visual essays. I mean, there are release notes too! I often considered people doing these mockups has being Apple‚Äôs cheap labour. I wonder if Apple‚Äôs designers notice those.</p>

<p>I got the new Magic Keyboard with Touch ID. I chose the one without the numeric keypad; the desk space being scarce. Setting this thing up took one minute. I had to read the (slim) manual as I wasn‚Äôt sure how the pairing would work: connect the keyboard to my M1 Mac mini with the provided USB-C to Lightning cable, quickly press the M1 Mac mini power button two times to trigger the setup process for Touch ID configuration (Bluetooth is automatically configured). The Touch ID setup screen looks similar to the one on the iPhone when settings up Touch ID for the first time. It‚Äôs one of the best Apple keyboard; keys feeling is similar to the previous generation. Touch ID is the star of the show here, and I love it. Only works with M1 Macs. This Magic Keyboard brings to the Mini, a feature otherwise only available to the MacBooks (and the M1 iMac). That‚Äôs why I bought the keyboard. It‚Äôs not cheap, but convenience has a price for Apple.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t remember when there was a dedicated Store section on the Apple.com website. Apple brought it back, leaving &ldquo;Buy&rdquo; buttons scattered around every single product pages. It is now so much easier to buy something from Apple these days.</p>

         	<p>Yesterday, Apple made some changes to their website with the introduction of a new Store tab at the top of their website. Not only that, but the store design has been completely redone. I find it a bit disorienting at first, but after a few minutes, I think the elements and general reorganization make sense; I find it easier to navigate in general. Apple chose the horizontal scrolling sections instead of going vertical. I‚Äôm not always sure this is the best way to go, though. The bouncing effect is inconsistent, it‚Äôs there while going to the right but not when hitting the limit on the left. AirTags have their section, which is surprising for such a small device.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs interesting to note that Apple‚Äôs top navigation bar is now spanning a store, physical products, services, support, search, and a shopping cart.</p>

<p>Apple is getting ready for this fall slew of new products. Oh, one of the first thing I noticed is that the Magic Keyboard With Touch ID that is bundled with the 24‚Äù iMac is now sold separately. I ordered one for my M1 Mac mini. It will take less space on my desk and Touch ID will so much more convenient for the mini. One last thing: convenience has a price: 179 CAN$. Ouch.</p>

         	<p>Matt Birchler had an interesting <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/my-2013-iphone-home-screen/">blog post</a> this week about a screenshot of his 2013 iPhone home screen. There are a few interesting things to note. In 2013, it was the arrival of the controversial iOS 7 redesign. It&rsquo;s interesting to look at the Camera+ icon design which was still not updated for the new style. The dock design style was pretty basic and felt out of place. A few apps are not longer among us these days: Path (which was really a great design example) but most of the third-party apps are still available today.</p>

<p>I wish I had kept screen shots of previous home screen arrangements in the past. Something that I have kept is many screen shots of my password manager user interface dating back pre-iOS 7 era. Here is an example below. When I saw iOS 7, I didn‚Äôt have the courage to rework my design. The development of my app stopped right there. I made five thousands dollars with this adventure, between 2009 and 2013. Now I‚Äôm using a combinaison of 1Password and Apple‚Äôs passwords vault.</p>

Yet, ‚Äú_when you don‚Äôt know what is best, just add an option to Settings so the user can decide_‚Äù strategy seems to be the way to go this time. You know what‚Äôs my choice, don‚Äôt you?</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to jump in because on macOS, I don‚Äôt see the change as controversial as on iOS 15. I find it surprising that Apple seeks feedback on the new design. It‚Äôs a good thing but also surprising has they tend to do their thing alone. Now, they look a bit in distress while searching for a solution.</p>

         	<p>Matt Birchler <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/all-your-digital-eggs-in-one-basket/">writing about Apple ecosystem stickiness</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As I buy more and more Apple products, all of those Apple products get better. My iPhone is more valuable because of the HomePod Mini I AirPlay my podcast to while I‚Äôm working. My iPad gets more valuable because it has seamless file sync with my Mac. Reminders is better because it works with Siri in a way no other app is allowed. The list goes on. But this is of course also a bit of a trap. I can‚Äôt really get an Android phone, even if I think I would enjoy it more than my iPhone, because then my HomePods become worse, my Mac gets worse, my iPad gets worse, and my Apple services get worse. Because each additional Apple product makes all my other Apple products better, likewise removing something from that mix brings down everything else.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cannot use an Apple Watch with an Android smartphone. In Apple&rsquo;s garden, every product has an extension that takes the form of a service or another physical product from Apple. Did we forget that once upon a time we made a switch from platforms like Windows or OS/2? When a new offering is really making a difference, we tend to switch. Back in the days, a Windows PC was an island, leaving it for the Mac meant that you had to re-buy new software, a few accessories. All things equal, the switch wasn&rsquo;t necessarily funny. Today&rsquo;s digital world is quite different, for sure, but pose a similar kind of challenge when switching.</p>

         	<p>I‚Äôve been using Photos in iPadOS 15 since beta 2 and I must say that Apple is in fact offering a major update to their photos application. Beyong the updated Stories automatic creation and management improvements, face recognition has become quite impressive. According to a <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/recognizing-people-photos">published article</a> by Apple, people faces should be more detectable and recognizable in more extreme conditions. I can confirm this is actually the case. A large number of new photos were surfaced by Photos‚Äô improved algorithms which brings more potential content for new stories creation. Managing tagged faces is easier too and provides a refined experience overvall. Photos enhancements in iPadOS 15 is a big reason to upgrade.</p>

The Apple Silicon optimized version is faster but not as much as I thought it would be. My Mac mini never stop to impress me, it&rsquo;s such a fast device.

While it is probably based on their previous offering, Windows Virtual Desktop service, it does look like a milestone to me. I‚Äôve been in IT for more than 25 years. I saw the migration from the mainframe to the client-server applications architecture. After that, it was about virtualization taking over with the popular VMware hypervisor. In the last five years, I saw the cloud taking over the IT world. The latter has a much more profound impact than any trend I witnessed or was part of in my career.</p>

<p>PC in the cloud is only offered to business customers, for now. I can see Microsoft offering the service to the general public in a not too distant future. I‚Äôll probably subscribe to an instance for my personal needs. Being able to run the PC in a browser means being able to use it on any of my current Apple devices, from the M1 Mac mini to my iPad Pro. This is something Apple will never enable itself, certainly not within Safari. The future looks interesting.</p>

&gt;‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really identify anything that I‚Äôll be nostalgic for in ten or twenty years.‚Äù</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go back to pre-iOS 7 days but there has to be some delightful in-between degree of crafted user interface that had some real joyful elements in them. Apple is not the only one at fault here. It looks like it is a design trend spanning many mediums (print, TV, web, etc.).
&gt;Has the industry decided that our devices have reached a level of maturity that warrants making everything minimal, sterile, and utilitarian to help &ldquo;do work&rdquo; and &ldquo;get stuff done&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Excellent question, Tyler Hall.</p>

<p>Wow, that one is close to being hilarious. Big tech companies are the target of hate these days. Google was hit by another antitrust lawsuit by no less than 36 states about their handling of applications side loading on Android. In summary, it is so cumbersome to side load an app on Android, thanks to security measures, that it makes it hard for competing App Store to compete.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Google makes the sideloading process unnecessarily cumbersome and impractical by adding superfluous, misleading, and discouraging security warnings and by deterring users by requiring them to grant permission multiple times for a single app installation (discussed in more detail in Sections I.C. and I.D. below). The effect of Google‚Äôs conduct is to practically eliminate competition in Android app distribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Android is supposedly more permissive than Apple‚Äôs App Store and yet, it looks like it‚Äôs not enough. This lawsuit is a prime example on why I don‚Äôt like the current trend. People want more open platforms but it‚Äôs never enough. If Apple is ever forced to make profound changes to their App Store business, it will be the beginning of a worrisome trend that I prefer wouldn‚Äôt happen. I recently wrote about not wanting another Android platform. Now, I should say that I don‚Äôt want another Windows platform disguised in a mobile device. To me, it is scary and close in nature to the same problem of who should own encryption keys. Raging ransomeware cyberattacks are signs of what is coming on mobile devices if we open them up too much, just like Windows.</p>

         	<p>In preparing to move off my 2017 Intel iMac (and put if for sale), I must make sure to re-install remaining applications on my M1 Mac mini. Photography-related apps were the last to be updated for the M1 chip. Lightroom CC is now fully optimized, but none of the Skylum apps I was (rarely) using: Luminar 4 and Aurora 2019 HDR. After spending some time on their support forums, I found out that none of their apps are optimized for the M1 chip. I had to make the call: bye bye Skylum. I barely knew you.</p>

<p>If a software vendor like Skylum is unable to update their apps in a timely matter, more than a year after the M1 chip has been announced, I give up. It is sad because these are the kind of applications that would take advantage of the power of the M1 chip. Too bad. My photography workflow will focus on Adobe applications, for good or for worse.</p>

         	<p>The next step for Apple is to design for repairability which goes beyond recycling. AirPods are the worst example of this. When the battery life on these is reached, there is no practical way to replace them without throwing it to the trash and buying a new one. So for me, the right to repair goes way beyond having a choice of where I‚Äôm going to take a device for repair. It is about buying a device that was designed for and built to use recycled materials, but also it is about buying a device that can be repaired for basic things like battery replacement.</p>

         	<p>Since last year, I‚Äôve been making a <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/">major cleanup of my Twitter account.</a> I came from following more than 2000 people down to less than 300‚Ä¶ and my goal is to drop below 100. I‚Äôm slowly getting there. Here are a few take outs from this major cleanup of my accounts following list.</p>

<p>First, there are a lot of stale accounts on Twitter, which tends to artificially increase ‚Äúfollowship‚Äù. It looks like people stopped tweeting a while ago ‚Äî they left the building. Second, a bunch of accounts were iPhone developers that I started following during my indie developer era, back in 2009-2013. My interests have since then shifted to writing and blogging. I no longer need to get in touch with the developers community. Third, and this coud be the most troubling take out: Twitter has become less and less useful in my numeric life. Articles readings happens more and more though RSS feeds and Mailbrew. So, what‚Äôs left for me from Twitter? Getting reactions from people during specials events, related to Apple‚Äôs announcements. That‚Äôs pretty much it.</p>

&gt; Did the pandemic make a foundational change to the way we think about where we do our jobs? Or was this a blip, with a slow slide back to the old ways?</p>

<p>I certainly hope that we won‚Äôt return massively to the old days. For Apple, it looks like the pandemic was a blip and employees will need to be back at the office at least three days a week. It‚Äôs a corporate culture thing, which doesn‚Äôt get amended easily. Now, for employees not wanted to return to the previous model, even partially, they could become poaching targets by other companies where remote work is fundamental to them. This is where Apple could have to open up more.</p>

As much as things like AR and LiDAR technology help bring real world and virtual world closer together, UI design seems to go the opposite direction. Why is that?

         	<p>So, I took the plunge and installed <strong>iPadOS 15 beta2</strong> on my iPad Pro. A few observations. It‚Äôs beta and it shows. Home screen and widgets placement is janky. One springboard crash so far. All my apps are working just fine. <strong>Battery life</strong> is taking a hit. <strong>Text recognition</strong> in pictures is jaw breaking and open up all sort of new use cases. The <strong>QuickNote</strong> feature is a nice addition that will complement my blogger workflow. QuickNotes appear as regular notes on iOS 14. The <strong>loupe</strong> is back, thanks god, but I think refinements are needed: it is hard to distinguish from the surrounding text. I completely redone my home screen arrangment. I didn‚Äôt setup <strong>Focus modes</strong> yet as I‚Äôm not done with home screens setup yet, both are tied together. I love the new notifications design. I‚Äôm really liking iPadOS 15 so far. I use <strong>App Library</strong> a lot, much more than on my iPhone. 1x1 Widgets are replacing application icons on my first home screen page and I love it! Reordering of home pages is alone enough to justify upgrading! Didn‚Äôt use the new multitasking a lot yet, just played a bit with it and it‚Äôs a good improvement. Alt-tab in split-view will switch focus between the apps, welcome in 2021. Unpopular opinion: I kind of like <strong>Safari‚Äôs new design</strong>, not sure if this will hold true on the iPhone, though. I love the new keyboard overlay at the bottom of the screen; it is no longer as wide as the screen. I like the refreshed design of the <strong>shortcuts editor</strong> and the suggestions. That‚Äôs it for now. Back to home pages setup.</p>

Apparently, hackers came in by using an unpatched vulnerability on devices where the last update was issued in 2015 by Western Digital. This brings me to ask the following questions: were those devices directly connected on the internet? If yes, that dumb. If this was a known vulnerability, why WD didn&rsquo;t issue a patch? Companies should be required to publish security-only fixes for far longer than they do right now. I&rsquo;m sorry but 2015 isn&rsquo;t that old for such a type of devices. Finally, I personally own a Synology NAS, obviously not directly  connected on the Internet, yet, I have to wonder if it is still secure.

         	<p>This is one of the many reasons why I love Apple. They put so much money into this <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-tower-theatre-opens-thursday-in-downtown-los-angeles/">building restoration</a>, it is mind blowing. The amounf of efforts that went into renovating this historic site is beyond any public-founded projects could have done. This brings me to this interesting question by <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/apple-tower-theatre">Basic Apple Guy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(‚Ä¶) should corporations be allowed to get their hands on this historic architecture and turn them into private businesses? Rightly or wrongly, the fact of the matter is that many governments don&rsquo;t prioritize or have the means to prioritize the extensive work required to take on this scale of restoration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tend to have a polarizing view on anything related to architecture. My father was an architect and so I‚Äôm profoundly sensitive on the subject. Yes corporation can take over abandoned historic buildings as long as they do it under the supervision of an urbanism council or something like it. Here, Apple transformed a building into a store but each time Apple chose to do it in a gentle way. I mean, it is barely noticeable from the outside that this is an Apple Store. It‚Äôs a very respectful way to do it.</p>

         	<p>I‚Äôve been working hard in recent days to reinvent the way I use my Apple devices. The idea being to focus more, be more efficient, increase my experience quality and better grasb how and where I spend time as a blogger and content creator. Tools involved? Toggl, Timery, Shortcuts and Automation. The trigger? iOS 15. ü§ìü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

         	<p>According to <a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/iphone-13-and-ios-15-survey/">a survey by SellCell</a>, people aren‚Äôt too much excited for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Without trying to read too much in these numbers, I think the next major revision of Apple‚Äôs flagship operating systems will grow on people when they start to use them.</p>

<p>There are some profound changes like focus modes that has the potential to change the way we use our iPhone or iPad. It‚Äôs hard to judge this feature just by looking at YouTube videos. The new focus mode certainly requires a bit of setup and tuning but me feeling is that it will have a much profound impact on users than what multi-users support could have brought to the table.</p>

<p>How much Apple business did represent to Intel overall numbers before the Apple Silicon transition started? My feeling is that it wasn&rsquo;t that big. Ten pourcent, maybe? If Intel share numbers are falling, Apple is not the only culprit in my view. The move to mobile-only devices like smartphones which are not based on Intel&rsquo;s chip is the culprit.</p>

Did Apple announce something this week to appease developers relations? Nope. Will they announce something in the coming weeks in regard to App Store commissions? Who knows. If they do, they will do it in a position of weakness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If someday down the road we will be changing 70/30, then I think the question moves from ‚Äúif‚Äù to ‚Äúwhen‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù. I‚Äôm not suggesting we do anything differently today, only that whenever we make a change we do it from a position of strength rather than weakness. That we use any such change to our advantage if possible. And thinking about this long in advance can only help to look at an eventual change as an opportunity (with developers, press, customers, etc). ‚Äî Phil Schiller in 2011</p>

It appears I was wrong. Thanks to Matt <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/payment-processing-is-not-a-commodity/">blog post</a>, I have a better view of what goes behind the scene here.</p>

<p>That being said, Apple‚Äôs payment processing service within the App Store serves Apple&rsquo;s purposes and is the one that is very narrow, very focused. It&rsquo;s a good thing. I&rsquo;m not sure Apple has to compete against this industry. Allowing third-party payment processing services would need to focus on the minimum in order to protect privacy or help guarantee that privacy is in good hands. It&rsquo;s an attainable goal.</p>

         	<p>If Apple ups the game with iPadOS 15 (background tasks, better multitasking, external monitor support, etc.), we could see a situation where iPadOS crawls on lower or mid-range iPad while working like a breeze on the iPad Pro. Could Apple limit certain features to the high end only? Quite possibly. Your thoughts?</p>

<p>Consider the previous screenshot showing the popup menu when selecting a word in a document. This menu hasn‚Äôt been touched since iOS 3, if I remember correctly. Tomorrow, as we are about to get a peek at iPadOS 15 and iOS 15, I‚Äôm wondering if there are better ways to display such a menu. Consider a few design problems and possible improvements.</p>

<p>This menu doesn‚Äôt scale well; it isn‚Äôt exactly elegant. In some situations, we have to scroll through its options which is not always obvious and is tricky to do with the finger without selecting the option at touch and scroll time. Also, this design involves too much finder travel to my taste; I would prefer a more condensed version. The design is flat and doesn‚Äôt allow for hierarchical grouping of options which could help is situations where many options are available. The design is flat and is not as distinctive as it could be. Adding some depth, contour line would help.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions on how Apple could improve on this?</p>

<p>The Thunderbolt display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/apple-thunderbolt-display-now-considered-vintage/">is now a vintage product</a> for Apple. When I look at this beautiful monitor, I‚Äôm thinking about the recently introduced redesigned iMac. Many people would have preferred to see the iMac chin disappear. We should know better and see this is a distinctive design attribute of the iMac which make it look different than from a simple monitor. It‚Äôs an important visual differentiation factor in my opinion. The iMac is not a simple monitor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The elephant in the room is iPadOS. It‚Äôs just not good enough. In the same way that Intel‚Äôs chips were holding back Macs, iPadOS has been holding back iPad Pros. With Intel chips, the hardware was holding back the Mac platform. With iPads, it‚Äôs the software holding the platform back. This hardware is indisputably amazing, and iPadOS is fine for casual use. But it still feels like I‚Äôm trying to do fine detail work while wearing oven mitts for my day-to-day work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like Gruber‚Äôs introduction in his review of the M1 iPad Pro. But his review echos other reviews. Nearly all M1 iPad Pro reviews that I have read note the same issue: iPadOS lacks maturity to sustain iPad Pro aspirations. Can‚Äôt wait for Apple‚Äôs WWDC in three weeks.</p>

<p>According to circulating rumours, the Apple Series 7 will go through a small redesign. The Series 4 introduced a bigger screen but the overall shape stayed the same. This time, a more boxy look is expected. I‚Äôm not sure that I like what I‚Äôm seeing here on this mock-up. To me, the Apple Watch would loses some of its iconic traits. If this boxy design allows for more internal space, hence probably more sensors or new features, better battery life, so be it.</p>

<p>The <strong>‚Äúone chip SKU to rule them all‚Äù</strong> won‚Äôt last forever it seems.

<p>Ah, ah, another moment of Apple‚Äôs Bluetooth device not working as expected. Since I got my 2017 21.5‚Äù iMac, I‚Äôve experienced unstable Bluetooth connectivity with Apple‚Äôs mouse and keyboard. I don‚Äôt know when it started, if it‚Äôs related to a certain release of macOS, but it is happening all the time. The worst part is the mouse being jerky while moving on the screen. Bluetooth&rsquo;s instabilities also impact my AirPods usage with the Mac. My AirPods simply drops from receiving the Mac audio while in Zoom meetings. It is infuriating. Eventually, I need to reboot the Mac to reset the Bluetooth stack.</p>

<p>When I got the M1 Mac mini, I thought Bluetooth connectivity issues would be a thing of the past. I couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. It was worst. The mouse and the keyboard are both having instabilities. They need to be turned off and on to temporarily fix the problem, but eventually the Mac needs a full reboot. Again, this is exasperating. It is a well documented issue which macOS 11.1 and 11.2 tried to fix but the problems still happen, albeit a bit less often.</p>

<p>There is something wrong with Apple‚Äôs Bluetooth implementation in general. Is it the driver, the firmware, the chip, a combination of these that is at fault? I don‚Äôt know but the fact that this shiny new iMac with the wireless keyboard with TouchID stops working like Gruber experienced is not a good sign.</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk regarding the white bezel of the new iMac. I still don‚Äôt know what to think about them. They make it look like if there was a white masking tape all around the display. But the thing is, considering the fact that Apple‚Äôs macOS overall user interface is so ‚Äúwhite-ish‚Äù in general, this should help make the bezel kind of disappear in reality and just be an extension of the user interface.</p>

<p>The iPad is a mighty device considering its form-factor. Many people are asking for Apple to make Xcode available for the iPad. I wonder: who are asking for this? Are they serious developers or just hobbyists? I would find it surprising if it was the former because there can be so many tools besides Xcode that is needed I order to build an app, and not all those things are available on the iPad. Serious developers would need to bring in a Mac to complete the development picture. If this is the hobbyists, does it even matter?</p>

<p>Would it be the full version of Xcode or a diminutive version? If it is the latter, what kind of apps would it be able to create, and what are the others it wouldn‚Äôt? Would it be Swift-only with SwiftUI? If that‚Äôs the case, are we in the ‚Äútech proof of concept‚Äù territory or if it is a viable path going forward? What would iPadOS 15 need to make Xcode for iPad a viable solution? Better file management? External monitor support? A link to a Mac for certain tasks and features? Is the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro the only supported device or is the 11‚Äù version be supported too?</p>

<p>If you are a developer reading this post, would you use Xcode for iPad to build your apps if Apple made it available?</p>

Albums, podcasts and publications could have more squared off icons. Magazines could be more narrow to show off covers. TV Shows and movies could use the same artwork that appears in app.</p>

<p>Frankly, I <strong>love</strong> this idea. On the iPad, it could be the ultimate playground to play with this feature, thanks to the device size. I can see me adding all kind of stuff like my wife iMessage contact, an RSS feed to my favourite content creators, a shortcut to a podcast or an Apple Music playlist or artist. So much possibilities.</p>

<p>The idea of adding all sort of content on the home screen is not new, yet on iOS and iPadOS, current design feels really restricted. We are ready to go to the next phase in evolution. I want freedom in folder size and placement, I want Apple Watch complication-style widgets. I want freedom. Apple, by any chance, are you listening?</p>

<p>Consider this added to my WWDC, iOS and iPadOS 15 wish list.</p>

I don&rsquo;t expect as many apps to be available for the Watch. This form-factor isn&rsquo;t obviously suitable for a lot of applications categories. I think 17K apps is quite a lot actually because I don&rsquo;t get a sense of it when I browse the App Store from the Apple Watch itself or from my iPhone. <em>This is where Apple is failing: discovery of Watch apps is miserable, just like it is in general on Apple&rsquo;s App Store.</em></p>

         	<p>One of the cooless by-product of the Apple strategy is the unification of the processing unit among its product lines, leaving the form-factor the unique differenciation attribute.
&gt; Previously there were many people who wanted a laptop, but ended up buying a desktop because it would be more powerful. Now the only choice the customer has to make is whether they prefer the MacBook or iMac form-factor, because the internal hardware is the same in each.

         	<p>Browsers look more and more like operating systems. Apple knows this, and they are probably afraid for their App Store business.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/">article</a> from Alex Russell of <strong>Infrequently Notes</strong> is very convincing: <em>Apple purposely delay implementation of new web standards to refrain developers to build web applications</em>. New web standards are enablers for new kinds of web applications with richer features set. Those richer apps could go against Apple‚Äôs App Store profitable business. No wonder why so many people are using alternative browsers to Safari. But that‚Äôs not all. Since Apple, in general is a big player, its influence is unquestionably high, the lack of support from them for so many basic and essential web standards discourage new application opportunities. That‚Äôs too bad and makes me wonder how sites like Mailbrew who offers a web application could improve if all browsers, including Safari would support most web standards. Mailbrew is already good on the iPad, closely mimicking a native application, yet I wonder.</p>

<p>Can we hope for changes at the next WWDC conference?</p>

<p>Ken Segall on <a href="https://kensegall.com/2021/05/04/apples-troubling-stubborn-streak/">Apple‚Äôs stubborn attitude</a>:</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disappointing that the modern Apple is so willing to stonewall, and that it can take an inexcusably long time to set things right.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Mr. Segall piece is baffling. Taken together, those bad apples make Apple look terrible at design. Apple is opinionated and takes bold risks when designing new products and services. This comes at a cost, occasionally. Apple is far from perfect, but they should know that quickly admitting when they fail makes the mistakes more easily forgiven.</p>

<p>What Apple product currently shipping that has baffling design flaws for which Apple doesn‚Äôt seem to care fixing, beside the Magic Mouse? I don‚Äôt see that many as they silently fixed most of them in recent years.</p>

         	<p>Surprisingly, <strong>Apple&rsquo;s Night Shift</strong> does not help in any way to fall asleep, according to a study. Intuitively, I thought of the opposite. When Apple launched this feature, in 2016, they said it would help. It seems it&rsquo;s not the case after all. Will they backtrack and remove the feature in a future version? I highly doubt it. Many people do like this feature (I do on the iPhone, I hate it on the Mac), others like <a href="https://micro.blog/Gruber">@Gruber</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/04/byu-night-shift">don&rsquo;t</a>. What I don&rsquo;t like is when the feature is in action, opening Photos abruptly turn the visual effect off. The effect is brutal as the screen turns blueish and cold because of the contrasting mode. I would prefer a more gentle disabling of the feature.</p>

<p>One evidence taken out of the <strong>Epic vs Apple trial</strong> yesterday, the above email. This email from Mr. Schiller shows how unhappy he was with scam apps being #1 on the App Store. His numerous questions are expressing frustrations. He saw what we keep seeing all too often today, nine years later. So, where are the reviewers? What value are they adding to the user experience‚Äôs bottom line? Apple could strictly rely on machine-based curation only instead, but they prefer the added touch of human-based curation for the editorial content. Does it make a real difference? On the surface maybe. With the scale of the App Store, cracks are obviously possible, hence bas actors are taking advantage of them, to create scams one after another.</p>

<p>Apple doesn‚Äôt look good because some of their arguments aren‚Äôt backed with proven and irrefutable facts. As a gatekeeper of the quality on the App Store, Apple is failing. Big time. From scams apps to badly designed ones, to never updated ones, beneath the front page surface, the App Store feels and look like a junkyard.</p>

This is not an ad. I promise. I finally decided to enable <strong>NextDNS</strong> on all my devices and subscribed to their yearly plan after testing it on my iOS devices. The last configuration applied was on my M1 Mac mini. Oh boy, surfing the web feels like the internet back in the days. Places like CNN or iPhoneInCanada or MacRumors are now without any ads and are crazy fast to load. Now, I can see content without distraction. I feel that I‚Äôm back to the 2005 Internet. I feel that I&rsquo;m winning, for once. Numeric life can be good, thanks to NextDNS.</p>

One is, for the iPhone presumably, is a redesigned Lock Screen. I‚Äôm in for that one. In fact, I would prefer a customizable Lock Screen, more than a redesign. But, the most interesting part is regarding the iPad. At long least, Apple is about to bring the full widgets experience on the iPad. YES! I do have high hopes for that one. Having full liberty on widgets placement on the iPad screen will be transformative. Even better if they support some form of minimal interactions with the applications behind them.

<p>This is one of those days where it will be hard to stay focused, thanks to <strong>the first Apple Event of 2021</strong>. I‚Äôve got a pretty busy schedule at work, so I won‚Äôt be able to catch the live feed with full attention this time around. I know that all these notifications will spoil the show. Rumours and leaks already made a great job already, though. But, what if there is ‚Äúone more thing‚Äù?</p>

<p>Tonight, I‚Äôll catch it all up, partially knowing most of the takeaways. It will be weird. Who likes to go see a movie knowing the story line in advance? I hate that. üòí</p>

<p>Since Jony Ive left Apple, a few years ago, the iPhone design adopted an opposite trend of becoming fatter and fatter. It‚Äôs not a night and day difference but there is a trend. It is a welcomed one because this gives Apple more ‚Äúroom‚Äù to improve the cameras and the battery life. Speaking of the cameras, did you see the camera assembly protuberance on the CAD designs? It is getting bigger too, that I don‚Äôt like.</p>

<p>Tonight, using Craft, I‚Äôm writing my next piece for ‚Äú<a href="https://numericcitizen.io">Numeric Citizen I/O</a>‚Äù on my 2018 11‚Äô‚Äô iPad Pro with the Apple Magic Keyboard. I‚Äôm being this multitasking guy as I‚Äôm constantly switching between Craft, Soundcloud, Twitter, Safari, Ulysses, etc. Then, suddenly, my thoughts goes toward imagining what can Apple do to make me upgrade to the next iPad Pro.</p>

<p>You see, my current setup is near perfect for my needs and my current use cases. I‚Äôm far from maximizing this iPad‚Äôs potential. So, ask me again, why should I upgrade to what‚Äôs coming next week? I cannot see anything. Maybe Apple has a few well hidden cards, just waiting to be played, one by one at next week‚Äôs virtual event. We shall see soon.</p>

<p>At long last, Apple is calling the first virtual event of 2021 for next week. I have mixed up feelings about this one. AirTags, if they are real, aren‚Äôt game changer and really are complementary to anything Apple is doing these days.</p>

<p>I wrote a few times that for the iPad, the next major step won‚Äôt come in the form of hardware upgrades but in software, with iPadOS 15. And this, happens every year on June at the WWDC conference. So, unless there is a last minute surprise from Apple‚Äôs updated iPad Pro, my attention will be for the next WWDC, not this spring event.</p>

<p>Oh, about this rumoured iMac redesign, THIS I will be looking forward to it, but somehow, I think it is more a WWDC thing than anything else.</p>

         	<p>Consider the following App Store screenshot of a recently introduced game in the Apple Arcades service.</p>

<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/3ae407d65a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Reviews of this game are really bad because the game doesn‚Äôt load on people‚Äôs devices. Does Apple really test their stuff before putting them out? Tim Cook et al. brags all the time about being a mandatory gatekeeper for iPhone security and quality control with the App Store. In this illustrative case, and there are many others, Apple is failing big time to play his role. I just can‚Äôt understand why this shit is possible.</p>

<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/59af83bbcb.jpg" alt="New App Store icon design language?" /></p>

<p>I rarely comment on rumours from highly speculative reports, but this report from MacRumors is different:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe Apple Music for Artists app now features a simpler, streamlined icon with a pinkish red music logo rather than the multicolored logo that was used before. The icon also has an embossed look that makes it stand out from other Apple icons.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúApp Store Connect in October was updated with a refreshed icon that&rsquo;s similar to the ‚ÄåApple Music‚Äå for Artists icon, which means Apple has now updated two app icons with this new design.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simple fact that two icons got updated with similar look at several months interval could signal a trend leading to the upcoming design update with iOS 15. I much prefer the right version of these icons, particularly the embossed design. This 3D effect adds some depth and dynamism to the design, and yes I like the fine line marking the icon boundaries.</p>

<p>I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if those two icons were part of an A/B testing program, within Apple. Second, what Apple has done with macOS Big Sur was only the beginning destined to encompass all platforms, in some form or another (icon design wise).</p>

         	<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/464f6488e1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There is a lot to like in the recent Tim Cook‚Äôs interview with Kara Swisher (<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-apples-privacy-push-facebooks-existential-threat/id1528594034?i=1000515797139">link to Podcast</a>). It‚Äôs a must-listen. Here are a few observations and remarks.</p>

<ol>
<li>I love Tim Cook‚Äôs stance on issues like privacy protection. But at the same time, I have a hard time understanding how Apple can continue to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/aapl-raised-services-revenue-forecast">sign a search deal with Google</a> while advocating privacy protection. This is simply unsustainable and hard to defend if you ask me. I know‚Ä¶ $$$. Yet‚Ä¶ will they ever try to make their search engine or buy one like DuckDuckGo and kick Google out as the default search engine? That would be such a powerful message to send.</li>
<li>Today, Apple under Tim Cook, has never been so well positioned to represent the best corporate defender of many of my core values: <strong>privacy protection</strong>, careful <strong>attention to details</strong> in design, openness to <strong>diversity</strong>, <strong>environment</strong> protection, sustainable development, <strong>great user experiences</strong>. Apple is not perfect, far from it. Yet, there is nothing like them these days.</li>
<li>Tim Cook is candidly answering the question of where he sees himself in ten years from now. I wonder what are the plans for his or her successor? Does he and Apple‚Äôs upper management actively put as much thought into it as Steve Jobs did in his last few years at Apple? I wonder and I hope this is the case.</li>
<li>This interview maybe <a href="https://www.ped30.com/2021/04/05/apple-cook-swisher-sway/">seen as a bit self-serving</a>, yet it is what it is. We, Apple‚Äôs customers like me, pay Apple to make calls on issues like encryption and privacy protection, environmental protection, etc. That‚Äôs the way I see my voting dollars anyway. As soon as I like most of their calls, I‚Äôll be fine and be one of their customer. I dearly hope it stays that way because alternatives are scarce to say the least.</li>
<li>Is Apple playing the same rules for ALL developers? I doubt it. Is Apple‚Äôs curation of the App Store perfect? Far from it: 80% of the stuff in there is pure junk.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think it is important to stay critical about Apple. We must keep them on their toes.</p>

<p>In a word: <strong>Pocket</strong>. I‚Äôve been rediscovering this application in recent days, and I‚Äôm loving it a lot. I no longer read articles within Safari or News Explorer. As soon as I think the article is interesting, I save it to Pocket and continue from there. The reading experience is simple and is frictionless. Being able to tag and highlight each article helps me organize and add value to my readings. Above all, Pocket will become a repository of all my past readings. The recommend feature creates some exposure for the authors. Each of my recommendation is accompanied by some text. I love it.</p>

<p>You can have a look at my Pocket profile <a href="https://getpocket.com/[@numericcitizen](https://micro.blog/numericcitizen)?s=invite">here</a>. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Today, I have come to realize that, since its introduction, I didn‚Äôt see the iPhone 12 lineup in person. It‚Äôs the first time that I didn‚Äôt go to an Apple Store to see, manipulate and experience a new Apple product release. How big is the Max? How small is the mini? What about this new edge? The same goes for the Mac Pro.</p>

<p>The pandemic has really put a dent in our lives in some unexpected ways, big and small. But, do I really miss something? After all, the iPhone 12 is the return of the beloved iPhone 5, which I owned. I guess I‚Äôll have to wait for the iPhone 13 or whatever it is called.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm no musicien. I know barely nothing about music theory. Yet, I always wanted to do some form of music. Synthesizer would be my instrument if I was to do music. Yet, I‚Äôve been fascinated by music, especially electronic music since I was a teenager. I‚Äôm a big listener of techno and house music. Recently, I started to use my iPad while exercising on the treadmill to play video on YouTube of DJ doing mixes. This got me curious about the equipments and software DJs are relying on. I downloaded Algoriddim‚Äôs Djay app and stared to play with it on my iPad. I was really excited. I started to read more about the world of music mixing. So, I learned about DJ mixer, controllers, DJ software, music sources, digital record pools, file formats, MIDI, etc. Then, yesterday, unexpectedly, while visiting a music instruments store to see these equipments in person, I bought a Pioneer DDJ-400, a pair of small speakers, went home, enabled a trial of <a href="https://www.algoriddim.com/apps">Djay Pro AI</a> on my iPad Pro and started to plug all the pieces together. I feel like it‚Äôs Christmas time. Will see where it goes from here. Expect more details on my endeavour soon.</p>

<p>Apple just kicked off the 2021 season of high expectations, endless wishes lists, criticism, betas, crashes, deception, no-show products, expected hardware refreshes, iPad deceptions, etc. Again, this year, it will be a digital-only version, thanks to the lingering COVID-19 pandemic. I‚Äôm happy with that. As I wrote in the past, my hope is that this type of event stays digital. I‚Äôve never been to a real WWDC so I don‚Äôt miss anything.</p>

<p>Now, trying to read into WWDC‚Äôs announcement art: sure, there is this reference to last year‚Äôs Craig Federighi with its MacBook Air, but it is also clear to me that Apple is set to announce their <strong>AR Glasses</strong>. Yep. Remember, you read it here first guys. üòú</p>

<p>The article fails to mention a feature a <strong>HomePod</strong> replacement could and should include: <strong>home networking</strong>. I wrote about this many times. Apple left home networking market at a time where it was transitioning to WIFI 6 and home automation really started to pick up pace, thanks to things like HomeKit.</p>

<p>Mesh networking is something critical these days with the new work-from-home trend caused by the pandemic. Only Apple could create an easy to use networking product, √† la Ubiquity or something like the AirPort product line. Speakers like the HomePod mini could evolve to be mesh extenders. I don‚Äôt really care if this product does have a screen or multiple mics. Sure it has to be HomeKit integrated. No, I don‚ÄôT want it to be a successor to the Apple TV. Pricing would be too out of control. It has to be a separate product.</p>

<p>Leaving the home networking space could be one of the worst Apple decision in recent years. We keep seeing the consequences of it now.</p>

<p>According to 9to5Mac, users from Russia, upon setup of their brand-new iPhone:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple users will see a dialog box upon initial setup of new devices that features web browsers, antivirus, messenger, email clients, and more to be installed by default. The list of apps is provided by the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first, I thought it was a bad decision from Apple, to allow this to happen. Bending to state laws from a country like Russia doesn‚Äôt look good. Who‚Äôs next? China? What about smartphone carriers?</p>

<p>The headlines are scarier than the reality, though. Users will be able to uninstall those state-sponsored apps. Otherwise, it is easy to imagine many scenarios like the dreaded PC bloatware we had to endure in the nineties from Microsoft‚Äôs OEMs. Or even worse, what about state surveillance applications? How will Apple say no to those? Are PCs subject to the same requirements? If not, why?</p>

<p>On the flip side, I can see some situations where apps could be suggested that would make sense, like contact tracing apps. It could have made a difference if we had this feature implemented before the pandemic. Another case is to suggest a government sponsored app that gives access to services sponsored by the government (immigration, finance, security, etc.). Finally, what are those apps that will make the list when setting up a new iPhone in Russia? I hope someone will share their experience once the law comes into effect.</p>

<p>Well, rumours abound, changes to the Apple Store options for the iMac, the demise of the iMac Pro, something is really going on with the iMac line. As Apple is currently in the midst of their transition to a full Apple Silicon future for the Mac, we may find what‚Äôs coming next, sooner than later.</p>

<p>I always loved the iMac because it is the most truthful version of the Mac original vision. I owned a 24‚Äù 2005 white iMac, then a 2007 aluminum version before my current 2017 iMac, on which I work on every weekday, for my day time work. I‚Äôm really looking forward for Apple to inject a new dose of design language in general, but especially for the iMac. The chin, the bezels, the rounded back all feel quite dated and tired. The ultimate form factor is to get a screen, nothing more. Think of it like a big iPad Pro on a svelte stand. The next design has to be iconic. It should differentiate itself from the current iPad Pro or the ProDisplay XDR. Apple‚Äôs industrial design team must enter new territories, they have to put a clear mark on Jony Ive‚Äôs era. Everything in Apple‚Äôs current Mac product lines look and feel like Jony Ive‚Äôs team work. We are due for a new beginning.</p>

<p>Will this new machine come in April? I feel like Apple should use a more important event like WWDC or one of the fall keynote to release such a landmark product. Current movements on the Apple Store and recent discoveries in Apple‚Äôs latest beta software points to a sooner than later release. We shall see very soon, I guess.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/thunderbolt-ipad-pro-coming-in-april/">MacRumors</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Apple has tested ‚ÄåiPad‚Äå Pros with a Thunderbolt connector that would make them compatible with additional external monitors, hard drives, and peripherals, plus it brings faster data syncing speeds. Apple&rsquo;s Mac machines have featured Thunderbolt technology for years now, but current ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå and iPad Air models have standard USB-C ports.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such an iPad feature has to come with much improved operating system support for external devices, like external monitors, which is currently very limited under iPadOS 14.4. Expect an iPadOS 14.5 surprise support (something along he line of mouse support with iPadOS 13.4 at around the same time last year) or iPad 15 with profound improvements compared to iPadOS 14 which was limited in new features.</p>

<p>Personally, the key for a possible upgrade from my 2018 iPadPro lies in the software, not only the hardware. Also, rumours all points to the 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro, what about the 11‚Äù? I highly wish that Apple will make the 11‚Äù, just a smaller version of the 12.9‚Äù version.</p>

<p>What does the iMac Pro and the HomePod, two entirely different products, have in common? It‚Äôs not the fact that they are no longer being sold. <strong><em>The iMac Pro and the HomePod were created by Apple when they were caught off guard by market trends</em></strong>. In the case of the iMac Pro, Apple tried to answer pro users who were demanding a replacement to the aging trash can Mac Pro. Apple didn‚Äôt read the temperature room correctly. They acted urgently and responded with the wrong answer, the iMac Pro. The right answer would have been to fix the Mac Pro instead by creating another more modern version of the expandable Mac Pro, which they finally did later in 2019. The HomePod was created when Apple (finally) realized the smart speakers market was a thing. Apple misread the room temperature again with a high-end smart speaker which wasn‚Äôt that smart but sounded good. In such a market, pricing is everything.</p>

<p>Apple is at its best when they create products they want to use for themselves, just like they did with the iPhone. The Apple Car is such a thing really exists), the AR glasses (if such a thing really exists) are a potential case of such products. The Apple Watch was also built on the same principles of the iPhone: something they really want to use themselves.</p>

<p>I own two HomePod, paired together and two HomePod mini, placed in two different rooms. I love them all, but I prefer the mini for hard to explain reasons. It is sad to see the HomePro go. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/06/21/replacing-an-airport-extreme-with-unifi-dream-machine/">It could have played so differently</a>.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs the next Apple product to be killed? The iPod touch?</p>

<p><strong><em>Afterthought</em></strong>: what is Apple comes out with a new HomePod with an integrated wifi 6 router and maybe some storage, something along the line of the AirPort Extreme a few years ago? A new HomePod mini could also be released with wifi extender built-in. I would buy that in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>Spoonbill will send you a summary of changes that occurred on Twitter‚Äôs bio of people you follow. I wonder if this service can be tweaked to use Twitter‚Äôs lists instead. What about <strong>Mailbrew</strong>, maybe they could come up with a similar feature, which would be really cool.</p>

<p>Breaking <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/weather-line-app-for-ios-shutting-down/">news from 9To5Mac</a>, but official announcement <a href="https://weatherlineapp.com/blog/weather-line-is-being-acquired">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In recent months, we were approached by a buyer. They saw the uniqueness of Weather Line and the strong foundation we‚Äôve built. While we aren‚Äôt able to provide further details on their future plans for the app, we hope you can understand, and will look forward to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm kind of in shock right now. I recently <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/02/03/great-weather-apps-for-weather-enthusiasts/">posted an article about my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù weather applications</a>. <strong>Weather Line</strong> wasn‚Äôt part of the line up, but I did have it installed on my iPhone, and I‚Äôm currently a paying subscriber. Too bad to see the application go. But, why? The same happened to Spend Stack <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/02/14/bye-bye-spend.html">recently</a>.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs going on? How many developers invoked paid subscription model as being the only road to sustainability? Does it work or not? Is this the start of a new trend? There is something going on here.</p>

<p>When, as users, invest money and time in using applications or service, the last thing we want is to see our beloved apps go like this. I‚Äôm currently heavily investing in Craft (coming from Notion). What if the same happens to Craft?</p>

<p>This shouldn‚Äôt be this way. Thanks to the numerous ads, my YouTube experience was a calculated nightmare. As my usage grew in the last few weeks because of my daytime job, my time on YouTube felt light a nightmare with no end. I decided to put an end to all this by <strong>subscribing to YouTube Premium</strong>. I feel in full contradiction to my values.</p>

<p>YouTube Premium so much better. But it shouldn‚Äôt be this way. Yet, it is. I feel that I‚Äôm sleeping with the enemy. Tell me that it is ok, will you?</p>

<p>Here is the current state of yet to be updated apps to fully support Apple Silicon Macs. It‚Äôs been close to six months now and yet, those apps aren‚Äôt yet universal. Surprising to see things like 1Password 7 still not there yet. Notion, an Electron-based app, not surprising. The Mac client for HEY hasn‚Äôt been updated for a while. Many of those apps are subscription-based, a model toward development sustainability. Can we say they are failing to meet their obligations, now?</p>

         	<p>Today, I would like to do a quick poll among my blogger / writer friends here on Micro.blog. <strong><em>How did the pandemic influence your writing habits?</em></strong> Do you write more? Less? What could be the reasons behind the change of habit?</p>

<p>To help you out and start the thread, I‚Äôll answer to my own poll. The pandemic brought me closer to be what we call ‚Äúa writer‚Äù. I write a lot more. I do put more efforts into each piece. I use more tools to help me. My research goes deeper. I have many pieces in the works, all the time. I spend around 5-10 hours for writing each week.</p>

<p>Now, why do I write more? Because there is less noise in my life in general, thanks to the restrictions (no travels, curfew, work from home: no commute). This ‚Äúsilence‚Äù created a pool of free time. My creativity took over. So, I write. And I love it.</p>

<p>Today, I tested <strong>HEY World</strong>. This is my non-review. It could have worked great, but it‚Äôs not ready yet. One could say ‚ÄúNice try, buddy‚Äù.</p>

<p>I love their response to my test message. One thing stands out from their response, though:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúFor now, HEY World is just an experiment. ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚ÄúAssuming there‚Äôs demand, we‚Äôll begin opening it up for more people soon. And then, hopefully, for all HEY for You customers. <strong>Personal blogs will finally be as easy as sending an email</strong>.‚Äù</p>

<p>It seems to me that they are on the fence. They already have their tag line. They keep the door wide open. Could it be closer than we think or want to say it?</p>

<p>Now, what I‚Äôd like to see is how many emails like mine they get each day and what are they saying?</p>

<p>If they actually turn the switch on, count me in. I‚Äôll find a use of it. For sure.</p>

<p>After reading ‚Äú<a href="https://tablethabit.com/archive/ghost-on-the-ipad-a-review/">Ghost on the iPad, a Review‚Äù</a> from <strong><em>Tablet Habit</em></strong>, I tried to remember my experience when <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/05/09/my-ghost-experiment/">I tried the service myself</a>. It wasn‚Äôt a good one for the thing I wanted to do with it: create a photography-oriented blog.</p>

<p>In recent days, it seems that the ‚Äú<strong>Ghost</strong>‚Äù name is gaining traction in the blogging arena. I have to wonder if Ghost is better at this than what I experienced for photography. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll try it again, but I think they do have one killer feature that other platforms don‚Äôt have: the combination of a blogging platform and a newsletter publishing tool. They really look to be well integrated.</p>

<p>One could argue that the difference between blogging or sending a newsletter is small (Think of <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e">HEY, World</a>). I could easily agree. But sometimes, the actual implementation of the integration between those two features can make a real difference.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm currently using <strong>Substack</strong> for my monthly newsletter (<a href="https://numericcitizen.substack.com">Numeric Citizen Introspection Newsletter</a>) and WordPress as well as Micro.blog more my blogging needs. Sometimes, I do wish there would be less friction when I‚Äôm publishing my work. A single platform doing all of this in a basic manner would be certainly very enticing.</p>

<p>How many websites a blogger can have? Good question. I do have (too?) <a href="https://linktr.ee/numericcitizen">many</a>, each filling their own niche. On that subject, something caught my attention yesterday in the public announcement of <strong>HEY‚Äôs experiment</strong>: ‚Äú<a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e">Hello, World!</a>‚Äù. Jason Fried explaining why he never had a blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIt was primarily because setting up a personal blog was just too much of a hassle. It felt formal, it required yet another tool, yet another place to write, yet another platform to pay for just one feature. I had to pick a template, I had to think up a name, I had to make the relationship official.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, setting up a blog can be a hassle. For me, it is some kind of challenge and an exercise in creativity. <strong><em>This brings me to something I want to share with you.</em></strong> I‚Äôve been working on something new in the last few days. I‚Äôm very excited about it. I started a ‚Äú<strong><em>metablog</em></strong>‚Äù. Yes, another place to publish content. What is it? Well, it is a blog about blogging.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs see what Wikipedia has to say about the word ‚Äú<strong><em>meta</em></strong>‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any subject can be said to have a metatheory, a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its foundations, methods, form and utility, on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a metalanguage, language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do I feel the need to create yet another numeric space? Well, I believe in focused channels in general. I wanted a dedicated space for writing about being a blogger, using tools and services to put things together and out to the world. In other words, it is more about the ‚Äúhow‚Äù than anything else. I believe people like to get a look behind the curtain. I certainly do. So, I created this space where I‚Äôll post my updates to <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/30/my-updated-blogger-workflow-as-of-2021-01/">my blogger workflow</a>, in more detail.</p>

<p>So, there you have it: <strong><a href="https://numericcitizen.io">Numeric Citizen I/O</a></strong>. You‚Äôll be able to comment on each individual post (I‚Äôm using Commento, a privacy-friendly commenting service.).

<p>Each day, it seems there is always something new happening in the world of newsletters. When it‚Äôs not someone famous who joins Substack, a company out of nowhere offers a brilliant idea built around supporting newsletters in one way or the other. I‚Äôm thinking of Hey in particular.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúEmail is the internet&rsquo;s oldest instant self-publishing platform. Except you have to define a small audience every time you write. But what if you didn&rsquo;t? What if you could just email the web to reach the world? Introducing the HEY World experiment‚Äù - Jason Fried from HEY</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yesterday, the company behind the popular HEY email client tentatively announced a new service for their customers. The idea behind is to allow any HEY users to create newsletters and publish them just by sending them to world@hey.com. The service would then post these newsletters on the web, complete with the author‚Äôs name. A simple static page, no tracking, no nothing more. I call this: simply brilliant.</p>

<p>The service is not currently available, only in some form of alpha-stage for internal use only. They announced it to read the room and see if there is some interest in something like this that could become some soft of hyper-distributed publishing platform.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm personally interested in this kind of service simply because it removes friction in the publishing process. What could be simpler than just writing the newsletter like we do with emails and then hit ‚Äúsend‚Äù!? Simply brilliant. For the reader, they can subscribe by email or by using the available RSS feed.</p>

<p>You can read the announcement <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e">here</a>. I like the simplicity of this implementation. Very clean. Very lean. I‚Äôm in love. Too bad this isn‚Äôt available ‚Äî yet.</p>

<p>9to5Mac <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/22/should-you-buy-ipad-air-or-ipad-pro/">published</a> a nice comparison between the iPad Air and the 2020 iPad Pro. The latter still hold the crown with its 120Hz ProMotion display and LiDAR. Rumours are pointing to an update for the Pro line in March. The question that comes to my mind is: <strong>what‚Äôs missing from the iPad Pro, from the hardware point of view?</strong> I mean, speed, screen, form factor are just close to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. The main challenge for the iPad line is on the software side. To me, iPadOS 15 and Apple willingness to cross boundaries can‚Äôt come soon enough. Better multitasking and external screen support would really help fix long standing issues with the iPad.</p>

<p>My go-to email client got an update today. <strong>Hey</strong> version 1.2 brings a few tweaks in the compose mode. In recent weeks, updates are more frequent as they finally delivered support for corporate email. Now, the other thing I‚Äôd like to see is a collapsible view in the feed view. I don‚Äôt see how pinch-to-zoom can be added without implementing the opposite to bring a collapsed view.</p>

<p>In the last few months, on Twitter and on Micro.blog, I‚Äôve been witnessing something that takes the shape of a small phenomenon: <strong>people are moving from one place to another in the digital space.</strong> Many are writing about their experience of moving from one hosting site to another. Some are leaving WordPress to return to Ghost. Others are proudly putting together their hosting solutions. The same happens in the newsletters hosting space: people are leaving Mailchimp to go to Substack or Revue. People are looking to get better return on their investment both in time and money. Others are simply trying to optimize their blogging workflow. There is a myriad of reasons why people decide to leave a place for another one.</p>

<p>I find these numeric movements quite fascinating. Are you one of those guys?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/0cff8ddb96.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So I started another experiment involving <strong>Blot.im</strong>. For those who don‚Äôt know Blot.im, it is a static web site generator that seems popular among the crowd here. On paper, the process of publishing is very simple: you drag and drop files on a specific folder on your computer and they get instantly published on the web. Sound great, right? That‚Äôs what I thought.</p>

<p>My goal with Blot.im is to do some ‚Äúmeta blogging‚Äù; a place where I could write about the tools, services and my blogger workflow. So I registered a new domain with GoDaddy: <strong>numericcitizen.io</strong>. Then, I opened my Blot.im account and stated experimenting. The initial setup is pretty simple. And then challenges pretty quickly started to emerge.</p>

<p>First, I wanted my new domain to point my Blot.im domain. Tried to follow the Blot.im <a href="https://blot.im/how/configure/domain">instructions</a> to make it work but all attempts failed. GoDaddy doesn‚Äôt support ALIAS DNS records as Blot.im ask me to create. I asked for help from Blot.im support. Still a work in progress.</p>

<p>Second, I chose to use Git as the ‚Äúclient‚Äù to push content on the service because I don‚Äôt want to use Dropbox, a service I despise. By using Git, I need a Git client on my Mac. I‚Äôm tentatively settled on Nova. So far so good. After cloning the Git repo from Blot.im to my local machine, I can then use Ulysses to write my posts and push them with Nova. The workflow is very geeky: create .MD file in Ulysses, ‚Äúcommit‚Äù within Nova then hit ‚Äúpush‚Äù to publish. Not as seamless as I would like. But here another issue: inserting images with a Markdown file is not as easy as it seems. Again, trying to figure out instructions on Blot.im site doesn‚Äôt work. The other thing is that if you drop an image within a folder, it will trigger Blot.im to create its own blog post, something that I don‚Äôt want. Not cool. Again, I‚Äôm asking support to help me here with this supposedly trivial task.</p>

<p>Third, I would like to use <strong>Github</strong> as the source of truth. Setting up a new repo is simple and cloning it to my local machine too. But, now, how do I make Blot.im to use the Github repo as the source of content? Again, trying to figure out Blot.im <a href="https://blot.im/how/clients/git">instructions</a> but failing to make it work. Still trying to figure that out.</p>

<p>Fourth, tweaking the visual appearance is not as easy as I would have liked. There is a theme editor and I still need to be pretty knowledgeable in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. I did fork one of the theme to make it mine and started to do some tweak but it is a painful trial-and-error process.</p>

<p>All in all, I‚Äôm far from positive about Blot.im right now. I spent way too much time on these issues. I‚Äôm not sure where this is all going. If you are using Blot.im, please, do me a favour and chime in!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm in love with Micro.blog. It‚Äôs simple, not too busy. Based on open web standards. But today, I‚Äôm a bit frustrated with the bad sad of being too simple. My most important grievance is the lack of design flexibility. Built-in themes are too basics and unappealing. You have to be a HTML and CSS expert to try to figure out how to make simple tweaks. This frustration is behind my recent desire to look elsewhere for hosting the whole thing. I‚Äôm willing to invest quite a bit of my time to gin control of the appearance of my online presence. I‚Äôm patient. The guys behind Micro.blog are working on the next features and I hope they will address some of my complaints.</p>

<p>It all started with the idea of tweaking my <strong>micro.blog</strong> visual theme. I don‚Äôt like it, but this is the best that I could find from the included themes. After reading for a while and seeing people writing about their blogger workflow, I found out that Micro.blog is using <strong>Hugo</strong>, a static website generator. Then I started to learn about Hugo by searching for introduction videos on YouTube. Then, I learned about Hugo themes and how they are constructed, and at the center of how a website is displayed. Since static websites need a place to be stored, <strong>GIT</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> came into the picture. So, I started to read about GIT and Github. Git and Hugo both can be installed on my Mac mini to locally create content and generate a microblog from that. It a great experimentation place to learn and dig a bit deeper. Github is also a place to find new Hugo-based visual <strong>themes</strong>. Then I learned that I can import one of those themes on my machine so can change the visual appearance of my local Hugo microblog. Then, came the idea of publishing this content on the web, on Github, for free. To close the loop, services are available to take Github content and generate a <strong>static website</strong>, again using Hugo, behind a domain name of my choice. Then came the question: why do I need Microblog then? I could own the whole widget! It‚Äôs not that simple.</p>

<p>All this because I‚Äôm not satisfied with my current Micro.blog visual appearance. The next step is to dig within Micro.blog custom templates and see how I can update them. I‚Äôll have to refresh my memory about <strong>HTML</strong> and learn a bit of <strong>CSS</strong>. The latter seems a bit an arid subject. Oh well.</p>

I do appreciate when a service do put out their roadmaps so the community get a better look at where things will be going in the future. Mailbrew, Plausible and Craft are very vocal about their future plans, you just have to find the place where they talk about it.</p>

<p>So, where is Micro.blog heading? In particular, how do you plan to expand on themes support and customizability? Why the web editor doesn&rsquo;t allow support for Grammarly? Do you plan an opt-in option to see how many followers a user have? Those are just a few questions that I have regarding Micro.blog future plans. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>As much as you can like to work on the iPad, there are edge cases where the iPad falls short. Since I got an Apple Silicon powered Mac, and thanks to many nifty Mac utilities, I rediscovered what it really means to be productive and efficient on a computer platform. <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/matt-goes-back-to-the-mac/">This blog post</a> by Matt Birchler is an example of an edge case being better served by a traditional yet powerful computer.</p>

Maybe others would be interested to discuss their options and workflow too. Chime in!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start like this: I started to look closely at Hugo and now I do have a better idea of this engine. What is less clear is this. Suppose I&rsquo;m running an instance of Hugo on my M1-based Mac mini. Where does Github fit? Why I would use it?</p>

<p>As reported by MacRumors, the next major revision of the iPhone looks promising for me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Weinbach claims that the always-on display will look like a &ldquo;toned down Lock screen,&rdquo; where the clock and battery charge are always visible, and past notifications are shown through &ldquo;a bar and icons.&rdquo; When users receive a notification, the notification will &ldquo;pop up normally except that the screen will not entirely light up.&rdquo; Instead, &ldquo;it will display it just like you&rsquo;re used to right now, except dimmed down and only temporarily,&rdquo; according to the leaker.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An always-on display is on top of my wish list. How would Apple take advantage of this, at iOS level, is more interesting. Then comes the return of the Touch-ID. I would love to see go in the power button. A smaller notch? What notch?</p>

<p>As shown above, 9to5Mac ran a poll where more than 7000 people chose what feature are the most interesting to them. The return of Touch ID was #1 request at the time of casting my vote. Does COVID-19 have something to do with it?</p>

<p>Last year I skipped iPhone 12. This year, with iPhone 13, things could be different.</p>

<p>Here are two simple but very useful tricks using an iPhone with a <strong>U1 chip</strong>, <strong>iOS 14.4</strong> and an <strong>HomePod mini</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Trick #1</strong>: set a timer with Siri on your HomePod mini to, let‚Äôs say, 10 minutes. Then, bring your iPhone close to the HomePod mini, the iPhone will show how much time is left on the timer (make sure the iPhone screen is on).</p>

<p><strong>Trick #2</strong>: let‚Äôs say music is playing on your HomePod mini, and that you want to, silently, see what‚Äôs playing. Again, bring your iPhone close to the HomePod mini, the iPhone will show the currently playing title.</p>

<p>What a great example of: the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts. This is Apple at it‚Äôs best.</p>

<p>It is a bit of a sad day: I decided to delete the excellent expense tracking app <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spend-stack-budget-tracker/id1329068268" title="Spend Stack App Store URL">Spend Stack</a></strong> from my devices and revert to using a simple Numbers spreadsheet to track my subscriptions. Why did I delete this app?</p>

<p>First, the developer <a href="https://www.swiftjectivec.com/a-new-home-for-spend-stack/" title="Spend Stack finds a new owner">sold the app to somebody else</a>. Since last September, no more updates. Second, there is no clear roadmap announcements by the new owner. Nothing. I can‚Äôt rely on ephemeral applications even for simple things.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is something that happens all the time these days. Some developers are building great stuff but on the wrong business model. Others are just finding new priorities in their life which have side effects on their personal development projects.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm back to Apple‚Äôs Numbers and a simple spreadsheet. Sometimes, the best is still in the most basic form and function.</p>

<p>Yes, the title says it all: <strong>I‚Äôm looking for new friends to follow on Micro.blog</strong>. After <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/" title="My Twitter Cleanup for a renewed experience">my big Twitter cleanup</a>, the noise in my numeric life has dramatically decreased. I feel zen and I think this is what Micro.blog is all about: a zen place to meet virtual friends sharing the same passions.</p>

<p>So, I‚Äôm looking for friend suggestions. Let‚Äôs call this ‚Äú_<strong>the community-fed referrals day!</strong>_‚Äù. To help you make such referrals, please do remember about my passions: <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>photography</strong>, <strong>privacy protection</strong> and <strong>climate change</strong>.</p>

<p>This brings me to something that I‚Äôd like to see improved about Micro.blog: discoverability. When looking to discover new people to follow, we do see a posts count on each user profile, but we don‚Äôt know ¬´¬†how recent¬†¬ª the last post is. We know about stale accounts on Twitter, I don‚Äôt want to follow stale accounts here. Next, I‚Äôd like to see some kind of ¬´¬†behind the scene¬†¬ª analysis of how someone could be interesting for me. I do understand that this is entering a dangerous territory of ¬´¬†algorithm fed¬†reality¬†¬ª. I guess it is har to strike a balance in that respect. Finally, the categories are lacking a bit of breath. Where is ‚ÄúTech‚Äù or ‚ÄúPrivacy‚Äù or ‚ÄúClimate‚Äù?</p>

<p>So, I‚Äôm waiting for your referrals. Thanks for taking some of your time to do so. üôÇ</p>

<p>Here is a simple one: Apple, please, no.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt get the idea of <a href="https://aderosa.myportfolio.com/apple-view">such product</a>. The audience for this seems to be too small for Apple. I do understand that Apple research in VR can have broader ramifications, but to build such a limited appeal product for the mass, I don‚Äôt get it.</p>

<p>I think Apple‚Äôs interests has much more potential in augmented reality products, services or features. Their work is already bearing fruit with AirPods spatial audio and transparency mode. These are much more appealing to the mass than a VR headset.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Maps</strong> is so much better than it was when it first launched back in 2012. It‚Äôs my go-to apps when in comes to finding my way. I never use <strong>Google Maps</strong>. Over the years, Apple upped its game. Recently, <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/12/12/detailed-apple-maps.html">Apple added the detailed mapping and the look around feature for Canada</a>, and it made such a big difference. But how much different? Well, look no further than <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/look-around">Justino Beirne‚Äôs latest essay: ‚ÄúWHY DOESN‚ÄôT ‚ÄúLOOK AROUND‚Äù COVER MORE AREAS?‚Äù</a>. It is a massive piece of work detailing Apple‚Äôs every advances regarding its mapping efforts. I wonder if anyone at Apple ever looked at his work.

But the problem is that the M1 chip is among us. Obviously, the carefully selected benchmarks results are published to people who doesn‚Äôt know about Apple. It‚Äôs an issue of perception manipulation. Apple is only getting started. Intel is freaking out and look desperate. 2021 will make matters even worse.</p>

<p>Matt Birchler is writing <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/another-god-damned-ipad-post/">yet another post about the iPad</a>. The last paragraph (emphasis is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWe live in a world where we‚Äôre surrounded by computers. People have a home computer, a work computer, a phone, a watch, a smart TV, and smart speakers. Hell, even the iPad‚Äôs harshest critics often have one that they use for watching video and playing games. <strong>The iPad is the only device in that list that some people mandate has feature parity with another item on that list</strong>.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is so true. I never thought about it this way. Why do we need to constantly compare the iPad to other computing devices to find its legitimacy? For me, the iPad is one of the best computing device of all time. There is nothing like it, it is singular.</p>

<p>According to a recent <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/02/05/state-of-apple-silicon---half-of-the-most-popular-mac-apps-still-need-rosetta">small survey by AppleInsider</a>, 53% of apps are running natively on <strong>M1-powered Macs</strong>. What about the remaining 47%? Well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWithout native support, they&rsquo;re run in Rosetta 2 emulation. That may conceivably turn out to mean that they run faster than they did on old Intel hardware, but it&rsquo;s not why you&rsquo;ve bought an Apple Silicon Mac.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the problem is that <strong>Apple‚Äôs Rosetta 2</strong> is too good at running non-native apps. It‚Äôs so good that they can run faster than on an Intel-powered Mac.</p>

<p>A lot of things are on developer‚Äôs shoulders. There are enthusiastic developers and then there are the lazy one. The former rush to add M1 support for their apps even if the performance gain is negligible. The latter either doesn‚Äôt care, think it‚Äôs good enough or they don‚Äôt have full control of the software stack they use to build their apps. Think about the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/blog/apple-silicon">Electron framework</a>. It does support the M1-powered Macs. Developers need to upgrade their apps to take advantage of the latest Apple technologies. An example if the email client for HEY. The last update came in September of last year.</p>

<p>As someone who use both, native and non-native apps, on my M1-powered Mac mini, I don‚Äôt see much difference, <em>most of the time</em>. Apps like Lightroom CC or Pixelmator Pro do show a big improvement in many operations. But for the rest? Again, Rosetta 2 is doing a marvellous job and the whole experience on Big Sur with M1 is really good.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs becoming quite frustrating to see Apple‚Äôs Safari not being supported for <strong>browser extensions</strong>. Safari is now reportedly supporting standard web extensions but with an Apple twist making it cumbersome for developers to add support. Apple being Apple, I think it is related to the requirement of having to download an application in order to be able to expose an extension to Safari‚Äôs engine. Thanks to privacy protection, Apple is forcing the game here, but this has real consequences.</p>

<p><strong>iOS 14.5 beta 1</strong> is out today with a slew of new features and small tweaks. Unlocking your iPhone while wearing a face mask, thanks to your Apple Watch, falls in the category of ‚Äúfinally‚Äù moments. In the tweaks category, the Apple logo of an iPad booting up iPadOS ‚Äúfinally‚Äù follows the device‚Äôs orientation. Updates to Apple Card too to support shared cards. Now, if only this could come to Canada!</p>

<p>I like to see other people talk about their own writing or blogging workflows. Here‚Äôs an <a href="https://gr36.com/shortcut-publishing-to-wordpress/">interesting tidbit from Greg Morris</a> about using Apple‚Äôs Shortcut to publish to WordPress:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúShortcuts is a really robust way to publish to WordPress and not have to use the WordPress app or third-party app.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple‚Äôs Shortcuts are also an important part of my blogger workflow. Since I‚Äôm using Ulysses, which supports publishing directly to WordPress, I don‚Äôt need a shortcut for that. But for many other small things, it is a valuable tool in my arsenal. Shortcuts are an interesting technology within the iOS and iPadOS ecosystem.</p>

<p>From John Gruber‚Äôs Apple report card:
&gt; &ldquo;I‚Äôm reminded of all the UI and interaction designs and changes in iOS and MacOS that are just bad. There‚Äôs a real sense that <strong><em>¬†Apple‚Äôs current HI team, under Alan Dye, is a ‚Äúdesign is what it looks like‚Äù group, not a ‚Äúdesign is how it works‚Äù group</em></strong>. Exhibit A: What MacOS 11 Big Sur has done to document proxy icons. Arguably it looks better to hide them. (I disagree, but I can see the counterargument.) Inarguably, they work far worse now‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâharder to use for people who use them, and much harder to discover for people who don‚Äôt yet know about them.&rdquo;
&gt;</p>

<p>Gruber often has an effective way of putting out his take on Apple‚Äôs issues. If you look and use macOS Big Sur for a while, you should get a feel that only the visual parts were redesigned, not the way it works in response to the user behaviour. Big difference.</p>

<p>This morning I got the most recent update to the venerable photo sharing service: <strong>Flickr</strong>. The only addition to this update, <strong>support for iOS 14 widgets</strong>. Finally! It‚Äôs quite a change from the usual ‚ÄúBug fixes and improvements.‚Äù. Even if I‚Äôm no longer actively using Flickr, I was happy to see that widgets were finally supported. So, I frantically updated the apps to have a look at the possibilities. What a let down. Sure, all three sizes are supported, but we cannot change any widget settings! How about being able to set the source for pictures or even stats or anything! Nope. I call this pathetic.</p>

<p>No wonder why I left Flickr and services like Unsplash took over the world. Over the years and during its tumultuous history, Flickr was a series of promises left without real and deep actions to transform the platform. They brag about having two million groups. It takes just a few minutes to see that a vast majority of these groups are ghost towns. And don‚Äôt get me started with the general design of the app and the website.</p>

What I found is a super nicely designed page with highlights of Apple‚Äôs ecosystem privacy focused features. <strong><em>To me, Apple‚Äôs privacy stance is a product, not a feature.</em></strong></p>

<p>Apple made mandatory privacy protection ‚Äúnutrition‚Äù labels on its App Store. One guy refuses to update its apps since then: <strong>Google</strong>. Maybe they are even worst than Facebook if such a thing is even possible. Was Google caught by surprise? Highly impossible. They had many months to prepare for that.

<p>Really nice update (and unexpected) to my preferred Twitter client. <a href="https://twitter.com/tapbots/status/1354150774247464963">Tweetbot version 6</a> received a refreshed design, full support for Twitter APIs v2 and cleans up unsupported features with latest APIs. <strong>Tweetbot</strong> startup is much faster than Twitter‚Äôs client and exposes a few features that aren‚Äôt available otherwise. Design-wise, Tweetbot contains a lot of nice touches throughout the app. Compared to that, Twitter‚Äôs own client feels uninspired.</p>

<p>Like a growing number of apps recently introduced or updated, Tweetbot 6 now is subscription-based. I expect a few angry users but I‚Äôm not one of them. I find the pricing quite reasonable. I chose to go with the yearly subscription at 50% price reduction, a no brainer to me.</p>

<p>Tweetbot has recently returned as my go to Twitter client during <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/">my recent Twitter reset</a> and I‚Äôm very happy with it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Someone stoled my most recent article</em></strong>. I hate when this happens. I guess my article was good enough for this guy to bother.</p>

<p>This morning, I got a pingback on WordPress for an article being published elsewhere as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/ac6224c149.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Someone copied my latest article ‚Äú<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/24/the-ultimate-twitter-tips-and-tricks-for-mastering-your-twitter-experience/">The Ultimate Twitter Tips and Tricks for Mastering Your Twitter Experience</a>‚Äù.

I paid a visit to the ‚Äúpublisher‚Äù and sure enough, 90% of my article was reproduced. The guy removed the screenshots but left the captions (weird). The title was modified too. The conclusion was removed. Here is what I wrote to the ‚Äúpublished‚Äù:</p>

<p>I also posted the same thing on the comment section but comments being moderate, I don‚Äôt think the guy will republish them. I will see what happens. This is the second time this happens to me.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong><em>The Startup magazine</em></strong> on Medium accepted my article submission. More than 750K followers can see it from the magazine homepage. üòÉ</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/1/17/speech-and-publishing">recent article</a> by Benedict Evans exposes how hard it is to ‚Äúfix‚Äù social networks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe internet and then social platforms break a lot of our definitions of different kinds of speech, and yet somehow Facebook / Google / Twitter are supposed to recreate that whole 200-year tapestry of implicit structures and consensus, and answer all of those questions, from office parks in the San Francisco Bay Area, for both the USA and Myanmar, right now. We want them to Fix It, but we don&rsquo;t actually know what that means.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I often think about issues that platforms like Facebook brings to our society. I don‚Äôt pretend to have any solution. I can‚Äôt quite define what Facebook is actually from a societal point of view. That being said, a lack of definition and understanding cannot prevent me to wish for things to be done differently. And I have one simple wish.</p>

<p><strong><em>I want the eradication of algorithm-based feeds</em></strong>. I want them to be regulated, prohibited even. At the very least, it should be an opt-in ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. I want the return of chronological feeds. No tweaks, no tricks, nothing more. Nothing less. I want all people to have a look at the same reality. Two people having the exact same followers and following the same guys should give the same timeline. Period.</p>

<p>Without hyper-manipulated feeds, we have to wonder about the usefulness of all gathered data about us and our behaviours. Maybe ads targeting doesn‚Äôt make as much sense in tact hypothetical context.</p>

<p>If two people don‚Äôt see the same thing, it‚Äôs because the choice was made by an individual wishing to control his or her exposure, not by a corporation‚Äôs algorithm or an arbitrary group of people.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs my wish. Let‚Äôs try it and see if things change for the better.</p>

This makes me think of the Apple Pencil exterior beauty but interior complexity. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/03/im-not-an-audiophile-but-here-are-my-thoughts-on-apples-airpods-max/">I still love mine, even if I‚Äôm not an audiophile.</a> ü§ì</p>

<p>What a pleasant surprise today: a big update to <strong>Craft</strong> was released. Version 1.2.2 brings a lot of <a href="https://www.craft.do/s/gy6m6pUAYiCxqA">improvements</a> on the table. This release should have been numbered version 1.3, not 1.2.2! All platforms (iPad and macOS) received attention and improvements. One of the most important thing for me being the addition of direct export to <strong>Ulysses</strong>, <strong>DayOne</strong>, <strong>OmniFocus</strong> among others. We could already export in TextBundle or PDF and Word but these exports options, I feel my data can freely move out of the platform. My blogger workflow is simplified.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm still working on my review of Craft by the way. It takes longer than I would have liked. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Bye bye dear <strong>TouchBar</strong>. Hello <strong>MagSafe</strong> power connector. Here‚Äôs some more ports. Rumours are pointing toward the same thing. Apple will revert many of its controversial decision of the last five years. Many will be pleased. Function is winning over form. I think Apple is following the trend they started with the 2019 Mac Pro which essentially erasing five years of non sense with the 2013 Mac Pro. Apple is fully back to the Mac. And down on earth, with all of us.</p>

<p><em>Clearly, actual creatives and professionals disagree with Apple‚Äôs soul-searching because if all of these rumors come to fruition, Apple will be returning to what was already considered the MacBook Pro‚Äôs zenith. Coupled with Apple Silicon and Apple could experience Mac growth that it ceded to PC laptops during these past years of stumbling.</em> ‚Äî Raymond Wong for <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/design/apple-macbook-revival-plan-is-stupid-smart-bring-back-old-features">Input magazine</a></p>

<p>Something we won‚Äôt get, though: a touch screen. We can‚Äôt have it all, right?</p>

<p>Since getting my <strong>Apple Series 6</strong> last fall (see my review <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/03/upgrading-from-an-apple-watch-series-4-to-series-6/">here</a>), my <strong>heart readings</strong> aren‚Äôt working as expected. I‚Äôm not alone who is experiencing this problem (just google it!). During a workout, heartbeats readings are not available for the first 5 to 10 minutes into the workout. On a 30-minute workout, it can make a big difference.</p>

<p>I think I found a way to greatly improve the heartbeats readings. Simply by wearing my Apple Watch as shown on the picture above. I must say that it is not perfect. As shown below, I do get a few minutes of lost readings, though, but not as much as before. The problem could be related to the presence on some fur on my front arm. Also, always making sure the Apple Watch band is tied close enough to the wrist is a must.</p>

<p><img src="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/99df752207.png" alt="A few minutes of lost heartbeat readings" /></p>

<p>Are you experiencing the same issue? Let me know if you permanently fixed it.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with a quote from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger (as reported by <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2021/01/intel-will-wait-for-new-ceo-to-make-critical-decisions-on-manufacturing-crisis.html">The Oregonian</a>)</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We have to deliver better products to the PC ecosystem than any possible thing that a lifestyle company in Cupertino. We have to be that good, in the future.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The fundamental problem with Intel is that they will never make the whole widget (the products) like Apple does. That&rsquo;s the key for insanely great products. Intel&rsquo;s CPU are small enablers at best. <strong>The vertical integration of the whole stack (hardware, OS, apps, services) makes what Apple is all about.</strong> There is no way for Intel to emulate that by cooperating with hundreds of OEMs.</p>

<p>Sorry, Pat, nice try.</p>

I don‚Äôt really know about Signal, but I do know about another one, <strong>Telegram</strong>. Now that <strong>Parler</strong> is out of this world, I‚Äôm wondering if people prefer Signal over Telegram. Is Signal more secure than Telegram? According to <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/secure-encrypted-messaging-apps/telegram/">this website</a>, Telegram, is apparently not as secure as its maker pretends it is.</p>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm wonder how these movements between messaging platforms would be affected if Apple decided to make <strong>iMessage</strong> cross-platform: on iOS, on macOS, on the web and on Android. Maybe this year the dynamic is different enough for Apple to make the move? Are they afraid that people will leave the iPhone if iMessage is available on Android? What is more sticky for the Apple ecosystem: the Music app or iMessage? In my opinion, iMessage is much more powerful than Music for keeping people inside Apple‚Äôs walled garden.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/">latest report from MacRumors</a> about <strong>Apple‚Äôs upcoming MacBook Pro redesign</strong> is quite interesting and intriguing.</p>

<p>First, the removal of the TouchBar and the return of the MagSafe technology is utterly surprising. If this is the case, Apple would be undoing five years of design decisions. A side effect of the TouchBar removal would be a more competitive pricing of the MacBook Pro line.</p>

<p>Second, the rumour about Apple opting for an all-out flat edge design makes me think the new MacBook Pro would be similar to two iPad Pro linked together with a hinge. Obviously, the screen parts would be thinner than the lower body of the MacBook Pro. Intriguing.</p>

<p>Now, if these rumours materialize, to me, it would mean that the current 13‚Äù MacBook Pro would be no longer necessary with a 14‚Äù model in its place. If that‚Äôs the case, the 13‚Äù MacBook Pro was only a transition and temporary move from Apple.</p>

<p>We are at the beginning of another exciting year for Apple.</p>

<p><strong>Mailbrew received a big update this week</strong>. The change log is pretty extensive. The most important change is that the home page and the whole user experience for that matter is now more about reading your digests than the brews edit view. I like this change a lot. Digests are presented in the order they were received. You can go from one issue to another easily for a specific brew. You can also select a specific brew to see associated digests. The reading experience is better overall compared to HEY‚Äôs Feed view. The only missing thing is a ‚Äúsave clip‚Äù option.</p>

<p>Beside links to external content, within a digest, when it is appropriate, there is a button for entering a reader view. In this view, a minimalist browser will let the reader immerse himself to limit distractions. It reminds me of the Safari reader view. There is always the save button available to put aside an article in case you don‚Äôt have time to read it at the moment. Mailbrew provides a separate list for those saved items.</p>

<p>There are a ton of other small change and improvements. Sharing our brews is easier. Sharing a digest also is closer at hand. All in all, this is a solid update to an already excellent service. You can read my initial review of Mailbrew <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/04/07/my-review-of-mailbrew-a-powerful-and-time-saving-internet-information-aggregator/">here</a>.

<p>Thanks to the small wonder, the M1 chip and the Apple silicon transition, <strong>Mac sales are booming</strong>. According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210111005300/en/PC-Sales-Remain-on-Fire-as-Fourth-Quarter-Shipments-Grow-26.1-Over-the-Previous-Year-According-to-IDC">recent IDC report</a>, Mac sales are up by nearly 30% compared to the same period, a year ago. Apple&rsquo;s market share increased globally by 1%, which is quite impressive for Apple.</p>

<p>My take: I have the feeling that we ain&rsquo;t see nothing yet. As the work-from-home trend continues, with the rest of the MacBook Pro line still to transition to the M1 chip, a long-awaited redesiged iMac, 2021 could be a monster year for the Mac and Apple.

<p>What does it take to be a hood programmer? Or better yet, what does it take to like programming hence writing or reading algorithms? Math? Language? Arts? A combination? When I started in computer science at the University, my friends thought that I was good at maths. It wasn&rsquo;t the case. Before deciding which field I would like to study, I was afraid of computer science, thinking myself that we had to be really good with mathematics. My experience shows that it is not the case. I&rsquo;m average at maths but good at programming and in computer science in general. Is it surprising? <a href="https://boingboing.net/2020/12/30/study-finds-brain-activity-of-people-coding-isnt-quite-like-when-they-use-language-or-do-math.html">According to this article</a>, no. In fact, computer programming isn&rsquo;t the same thing as doing maths from a brain activity perspective. It is more like something very demanding where a totally different part of the brain is solicited. Fascinating. It may (or may not) explain why you can be good in computer science but not as good in mathematics. Who knows.</p>

<p>By having a better understanding of what parts of the brain are solicited, we may find common ground with other disciplines. It is really hard to attract people in computer science and knowing what it takes from a brain perspective could help direct efforts of recruiting the right people who will like to read and write algorythms but are not good at maths!</p>

<p><strong>Alan Ralph</strong>, <a href="https://alanralph.co.uk/reasons-why-i-love-my-rss-feeds/">in a blog post</a>, exposes ten reasons why he loves RSS feeds. I agree on all accounts. When I look closer, it all comes down to: control. Control is something we don&rsquo;t have these days on social networks and social media. We live in a numeric world full of algorithmically-generated feeds and content. We lose control of our feeds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell">George Orwell</a> was right.</p>

<p>RSS feed, a simple and open standard, is the key, within an RSS reader, of a more open and  user-centered and mostly ads-free Internet. <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/01/04/dont-forget-about.html">RSS feeds are important</a>.</p>

<p>Thirteen years already. Gosh, time flies. Steve Jobs announces the iPhone. One of his best presentation. I remember it so well. At that time, I was a huge user (and fan) of the Blackberry. After using a RIM two-way pager for a while, I upgraded to Blackberry with a bigger screen with a monochrome display. But, with the iPhone, I knew, deep within me, this would be a real game-changer. My feelings were the same as with the launch of the Macintosh. What I didn&rsquo;t know, though, was how profound and long-lasting the iPhone-effect would be on the rest of the tech world. We still feel its effect these days. I had to wait until the iPhone 3GS, in 2009, to get my hands on one for my personal use. I was still using a Blackberry for the office. Yep, I had two smartphones with me all the time.</p>

<p>Unsplash started the year 2021 with a bang; <a href="https://unsplash.com/blog/introducing-visual-search/">they are introducing a visual search feature</a>. How cool is that! Use cases for this feature are aplenty. Imagine you come across a great picture on Unsplash and would like to see if there are any more variants of it. Here comes the new visual search feature. Here is another one that could be a game-changer. Suppose you happen to find a picture online that is tied by a very restrictive license. Copy this image URL and paste it in the visual search of Unsplash to see if there are any similar pictures. Voil√†! As the Unsplash library doubles every year, the probability of finding an alternative image increases. Lastly, the visual search feature helps you determine if a specific image on the way comes from Unsplash. It is useful to find the creator of the image when no credits are given.</p>

<p>Next week marks the end of a three-week vacation. I&rsquo;m lucky. Three weeks where I forgot about my work and became a full-time blogger, writer, content creator. Time flies. There is a need for normality, I guess, and this means returning to work.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://ipadinsight.com/ipad/a-few-ipad-predictions-for-2021/">his predictions for iPad in 2021</a>, <strong>iPadInsight</strong> puts multi-user support on top of its list for iPadOS 15 without mentionning a real use case beyond the obvious. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Do we ask multi-user support on iPad because it is something we take for granted on &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; computers? Or is because there is a real use case for that feature, beyond the classroom or the conference room? Does the multi-user support solve the problem of your friend borrowing your iPad while keeping him or her from seeing your stuff?</p>

<p>Enabling multi-user support on the iPad has profound implications. How would the instant-on, instant-use experience be impacted by having multi-user enabled? Is the security enclave capable of holding more than one user FaceID? How iCloud Drive data be handled if users both have their data in icloud, the same way as on macOS? What about apps collections being different from one user to the other, how the iPad homescreen change upon logoff-logon? How fast? What kind of pressure does this feature put on the iPad system memory? Would this feature enabled on the Pro line only?</p>

<p>For me, the iPad is a personal device, just like the iPhone. Apple likes it this way, for their bottom line. That&rsquo;s my guess.</p>

<p>Here is another wild one: Microsoft is reportedly working on making Outlook a progressive web application for all platforms. Progressive web application isn&rsquo;t new and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983886/microsoft-outlook-com-pwa-progressive-web-app-install-features">Microsoft already makes a version of Outlook in this format</a>. What is new is that it would replace all native versions of the Outlook client: no more are native versions of Outlook for Windows or the Mac.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure if this is good or bad news. I‚Äôm always wary about cross-platform tech. There is always something lost in translation. The other question that comes to my mind, why is Microsoft moving way from native applications in its ecosystem?</p>

<p>Yet, not all is lost, a good side effect of this move would be to reduce memory consumption on the client. As use can see <a href="https://twitter.com/axian/status/1346244995536228352?s=20">in this tweet</a>, the native version of Outlook can use large chunk of your computer memory.</p>

<p>If only Microsoft could finish the job started with Windows 7. Windows 10 user interface is a bunch of previously used visual elements that Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t care to clean up. For example, consider the computer settings area. On the surface, the iconography speaks the recent visual langague defined by Microsoft. But, as you try to go deeper to change a less frequently used setting, you&rsquo;re back to a pre-Windows 10 era. I don&rsquo;t believe Microsoft will do this &ldquo;major&rdquo; refresh as <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-sun-valley-ui-october-2021-update">recently reported by Windows Central</a>, not in a way they refused to do in the last ten years, anyway.</p>

<p>As a side note, colour me Apple fanboy if you want, but many pundits will grumble when Apple is actually refreshing the user interface like they did with macOS Big Sur (or iOS 7, remember?). At least, it is either consistently clean or consistently ugly, depending of your aestheticism tastes. You won&rsquo;t as easily find a macOS Yosemite visual asset in macOS Big Sur or even macOS Catalina. Inconsistencies do exist in macOS but they are usually limited to very specific visual tweaks (like to trafic lights placements).</p>

<p>I got this notification in the Wordpress.app this morning. Six years already. Over the years, I became a paying subcriber of their Business plan. Automattic offers great support when you need it. But in the least year or so, I noticed a change in the way they do business with us, paying members. There are a lot of reminders about additional services available to us. which aren&rsquo;t free, by the way. They keep advertising their ExactMetrics service that I don&rsquo;t need with tricks that I don&rsquo;t appreciate as shown in the second screen shot above. Recently, they started to advertise WordPress courses on the main admin page on WordPress.com. I really don&rsquo;t like the trend. And <a href="https://alanralph.co.uk/oh-automattic/">this story</a> by Alan Ralph doesn&rsquo;t help either.</p>

<p>I want to pick from <a href="https://initialcharge.net/2021/01/flash-eol-2/">this blog post from Initial Charge</a>. I remember a small story when the iPad came out in 2010. After a few days of playing with it, I went to the office to show it to a few of my coworkers when I got my iPad. After a few minutes of demonstration, I got two remarks. One was about the lack of a USB port. The second was about the lack of support for Flash-enabled websites. On that one complaint, I remember arguing about the simple fact that moving your mouse cursor around would trigger some flash-based animations like making a button bigger or showing up a menu on many websites. There was no such thing as a ‚Äúmouseover‚Äù event on the iPad, so those websites that were dependant on this would break the interaction experience. At this very moment, I thought Adobe Flash was doomed. More than ten years to get rid of this crasp. That was long.</p>

<p>Paolo Amoroso <a href="https://blog.paoloamoroso.com/2020/12/why-your-blog-still-needs-rss.html">writes on his blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Back in the early days of blogging, the tech press bashed RSS out of existence as it was supposedly too complex for ordinary users. To the point new bloggers don't even know what RSS is, some recent blogging platforms don't support RSS, and the blogs of new startups sometimes don't provide RSS feeds.</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame in a world where open standards are on the way out. RSS feeds are another important part of Podcasts, another open standard where big tech would like to monetize, i.e. make it proprietary.</p>

<p>Amoroso continues: <blockquote>The readers who subscribe to your RSS feed always see all of your posts. No matter what Google, Facebook, or Twitter decide.</blockquote></p>

<p>A long time ago I decided my blogs feeds would push the complete content of the articles. As I don&rsquo;t have ads on my blogs, I don&rsquo;t really care if the readers consume the content from the RSS feed only. RSS feeds are conduits who escape any algorithm-based feeds. It&rsquo;s the most direct connexion between a blogger and their readers.</p>

<p>For the best part, Amaroso nails it: <blockquote>They are the readers you want. The superfans who share your work. They may be bloggers themselves and link to your posts from theirs, or enable other opportunities such as guest blogging or podcast interviews. Those few RSS subscribers are much more engaged and valuable than the many who don&rsquo;t even click links on social media.</blockquote></p>

<p>If you know how to use RSS, you&rsquo;re my best friend, you are more then welcome.</p>

<p>Writing is an important part of my life. It&rsquo;s all about feeling creative, thinking, taking a pause of everything else. As a blogger, I like when people stop by and take the time to read my blog articles and then response with a comment. It doesn&rsquo;t happen as often as I would like. I would say, one percent of my visitors will do it.</p>

<p>For 2021, I decided to set a new goal for myself: stopping by, taking the time to drop a meaningful comment on a blog post or an article from someone else. I call this goal <em><strong>writer engagement</strong></em>. Some platforms are easier to interact with than others. I like both Medium and Substack for this. Responding to an article or a newsletter is just a few clicks away.</p>

<p>So, today, I dropped two comments. <a href="https://medium.com/numeric-citizen-tidbits/ive-been-writing-more-in-many-different-places-too-including-here-on-medium-933221af113c">One comment</a> to a post from MG Siegler about writing more often on medium. <a href="https://numericcitizen.medium.com/i-love-your-take-on-iphone-12-pro-max-capabilities-in-relation-to-the-art-form-called-photography-b5c33afb2ea9">The other comment</a> about a way to consider the iPhone 12 Pro Max as a tool for photography, from a too technical point of view.</p>

<p>The year 2020 came to an end without me posting my personal year in review. You might wonder why. I read many reviews in the last few days. Most of them are delightful to read as they contain gems about personal lessons learned, personal discoveries, etc. To write those reviews, you have to be prepared for that particular intention to write about it later. Without notes, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible and takes too much time to prepare. It also would be too easy to miss essential tidbits.</p>

<p>What about 2021? Good news, for 2021, I want to be ready. Now it&rsquo;s the best time to get organized. All year long, I&rsquo;ll be using the excellent notes taking application called <strong>Craft</strong>. I already started to put things down. The picture at the top of this post is a glimpse at my journaling space structure, where personal notes will be confined all year long. I&rsquo;ll use a monthly section for each domain or theme I want to touch on in this future year in review. I&rsquo;ll see where it goes.</p>

<p>I could add other apps and services like Raindrop (<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/03/01/things-to-look-for-before-buying-a-new-application/">which I tried</a>) or even Notion (<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/04/19/my-review-of-notion-from-a-bloggers-perspective/">which I love</a>) as places to save bookmarks. It&rsquo;s tempting to use more focused tools to fill a very specific part of a workflow. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a matter of preference or workflow optimization (you can read about <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/11/28/my-updated-blogger-workflow-as-of-2020-11/">my recent workflow update</a>).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid his maths are right, even if they aren&rsquo;t precise. Things could change, though, after Biden is officially in his Office. Even though, change of government takes a lot of time in the US.</p>

<p>I said it in the past: COVID-19 shows how weak the US is as a country to fight this non military war.</p>

<p>Two things. First, Apple&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 was and continue to be faultless. Some governments should take notes. Second, the closing-reopening-closing dance of their physical stores didn&rsquo;t impact their bottom line, not in a significant way, apparently. In a way, Apple is not only making and selling products, they are the product, it&rsquo;s not only how they look, it&rsquo;s how they work.</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúAccording to a recent Bloomberg report, Microsoft is finally getting into the custom silicon business. It looks like they are starting down this road primarily to aid their cloud and server business, but it‚Äôs hard to believe they wouldn‚Äôt have future plans to bring these new ARM-based chips to their Surface Pro X and other future models, replacing Qualcomm‚Äôs SQ1 and 2 processors.‚Äú</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúThe $10,000 question is, why did Microsoft wait this long? Why did they bother messing around with Qualcomm to produce ARM chips for the Surface Pro X only to get mediocre results from a chip that still isn‚Äôt fine tuned to both the hardware and Windows 10? Those results were completely and totally predictable. They took the easy way out and the Surface Pro X, while a really slick looking device, isn‚Äôt going anywhere because of it. Who wants to pay more and still have to make compromises in both performance and compatibility?‚Äù</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/24/in-car-experience-key-to-apple/">Goldman Sachs</a>, Apple doesn&rsquo;t care about the car itself. I don&rsquo;t care either.

A car is the least personal product Apple could ever make. Apple&rsquo;s products are about exhencing experience, life.</p>

<p>I can see Apple investing in in-car experience and selling it to cars manufacturers. But wait, there is a big gotcha: cars manufacturers doesn&rsquo;t care about the user experience. Maybe Tesla, but that&rsquo;s it. I cannot see them coming in drove to Apple to add the &ldquo;Apple Experience&rdquo; as an option anytime soon.</p>

<p>When the original iMac came out, in 1998, a first tangible and public sign of Steve Jobs return at Apple, I was perplexed yet intrigued.

<p>Yesterday I had my first real experience with the Disney+ streaming service on my Apple TV 4K. In a word: wow! I wanted to see the latest movie from Pixal: Soul. I decided to try Disney+ for the occasion. It&rsquo;s the best streaming experience I ever had. From the mandatory signup process to browsing content and watching movies, I&rsquo;m sold. Rightfully, Apple named the Disney+ Apple TV app the best of 2020. Not only Disney knows how to create great movies, they also know how to create great user experience for the Apple TV. Apple should take some notes here. Google, with its crappy YouTube app should just start over. Now the 9$ a month question: will I keep the Disney+ subscription?</p>

One is Unsplash and the other is Adobe Spark Post. I usually start by browsing Unsplash for finding the right photo for inspiration. Once I settle on one picture, I download it and launch Adobe Spark to create the initial montage. I make sure to reserve some space for the best wishes text. This year, I‚Äôll do things a bit differently as my cards will be digital-only. I‚Äôll send them via iMessage. Some people would prefer to have a printed version, but 2020 being&hellip; well&hellip; 2020, I‚Äôll go ahead with a digital version only.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a big fan of Adobe Spark Post. For some reason, I don‚Äôt see a lot of noise around it on the web. I use it for many other things than creating Christmas cards, as the picture above can show.

<p>After installing Lightroom CC on my M1 Mac mini, I spent some time with the Discovery feature. It&rsquo;s a place where you can see other photographer&rsquo;s photo edits. I find it fascinating and very helpful in learning how artists decide to process their photos. There are probably as many ways to edit a photo as there are photographers. The discovery feature has been introduced this year and can be very addictive. Be aware.</p>

<blockquote>When reviewing these images on a big iMac Pro screen, I was gob-smacked by the details that were visible to the naked eye. I was able to get my shades of black and whiter whites from the files. The gradual gradation of grays is part of my editing process, and I didn‚Äôt need to do anything much to achieve that. You can feel the fog dancing among the trees. You can feel the sunshine trying to fight its way through the damp.</blockquote>

<p>Man, I wish I had an iPhone 12 Pro Max, right now. From this article, my favourite pictures are the ones with trees, proudly standing. And yes, black &amp; white is often my favourite way to look at a scene. The pictures above are mine.</p>

<p>I have too many projects on my plate to complete and experiments that I want to try. Today, I&rsquo;m thinking about subscribing to <strong>Vimeo</strong>, again. I used to have an active account where I would publish photo processing session recordings with voice over. These sessions are still available by the way (<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2018/12/10/enhancing-photo-with-procreate-session-1/">one example here</a>). I stopped doing those because they were time consuming to create and publish.</p>

<p>Subscribing to Vimeo&rsquo;s first paying tier is not cheap. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, why not use <strong>YouTube</strong> which is free!? First, I don&rsquo;t like YouTube and the business model behind it. I don&rsquo;t like to depend on Google for my stuff. Vimeo is better in my opinion as a video content platform, for what I want to do. I prefer their embedded video player compared to YouTube&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t want ads on my feed and on my content. For all these reasons, Vimeo &gt; YouTube.</p>

<p>As more and more applications get the universal binary treatment to support M1 Macs, my iMac usage outside of my daytime job has decreased significantly. The list of apps that I cannot use on my M1 Mac mini is shrinking every week. It‚Äôs a good sign. Things are moving faster than I initially thought.

<p>Can you believe it, up until today, I was still resisting the installation of any non-native applications on my M1-based Mac mini. I refrained myself from letting in any Rosetta-dependant apps to run. I shouldn&rsquo;t have made a big story about this non-issue, but it&rsquo;s was more psychological than anything else.</p>

<p>The list of non-native apps is small, but it started to negatively affect my ability to complete specific tasks. These apps waiting in line were: SafariMarkdownLinker (Safari Extension), Grammarly (Safari Extension), Adobe Creative Cloud installer (required to install the native version of Lightroom CC), 1Password.</p>

<p>Today, I finally let it go and went ahead with installing these remaining pieces of my application landscape. I feel good, and everything is working just fine, as expected.</p>

<p>Today, unexpectedly and for the first timr, I had a chance to experience <strong>Twitter&rsquo;s Space</strong>. It&rsquo;s a virtual room of twitter users who can speak to each other. When there is an open space, a small icon appear at the top of your timeline among twitter fleets. Tapping on it allows you to enter the space. By default your mic is disabled. You have to request permission first in order to be able to speak. There is a speaker who controls people&rsquo;s requests to speak. People who are listener can react using emojis. It&rsquo;s pretty interesting, much more interesting than audio tweets in fact.</p>

<p>I spent maybe ten minutes chatting with the space owner about things like COVID-19, confinement in Christmas time and how to use Twitter space. Others in the room were just listeners. It was pretty cool. I can see myself using this instead of doing a podcast for example. It&rsquo;s easier to setup up, doesn&rsquo;t require a distribution platform to maintain. I could setup a space to talk about Apple, photography, privacy or climate change. Can&rsquo;t wait to try it out with my followers, once the feature officially rollout.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-proraw">&ldquo;ProRAW Is Here!&rdquo;</a>
 By Austin Mann:</p>

<blockquote>I suggest turning on ProRAW when you are shooting in extreme conditions of any kinds (extremely low light, extremely high dynamic range with super bright highlights and dark shadows, mixed light temperatures, and so on). Also, use ProRAW if you plan on enlarging the images (on screen or in print).</blockquote>

<p>ProRAW is about extending the possible scenarios where you can take great looking pictures. Just like in traditional photography gear, adding different lenses allow for more possibilities. It&rsquo;s incredible how far iPhone photography has come since 2007. I&rsquo;ll have to wait for fall of 2021 before being able to take advantage of all this as I&rsquo;m not planning to upgrade to the iPhone 12 Pro. If all goes well, I should be able to bring a shinny iPhone 13 (or whatever name they give for next&rsquo;s year iPhone) with me on my next trip to Europe, on October of 2021.</p>

<p>Is this new? I mean the format in which Apple is presenting the current iOS and iPadOS usage? The last time I paid attention to this, Apple was using a pie chart. I prefer this level of details. A few thoughts about these numbers are in order.</p>

<p>First, iPhone users are quicker to update their devices compared to iPad users. Second, Apple makes a clear distinction between devices recently introduced (in the last four years) from the rest. In both categories, the numbers shows that a vast majority of users adopt the latest release of the operating system. Third, even though people keeps their device longer than before, Apple keep supporting older devices (older than four years). All of this helps keeping the adoption rate at very high levels. Kudos to Apple.</p>

<p>These numbers also tell another story: Apple‚Äôs shear power over its install base is impressive. Apple has the ability to move it in new directions pretty quickly as users are quick to embrace new features, either by buying new devices or by updating their current ones because they are still supported by Apple. Will 2021 bring a different tone to this story with iOS 15? Maybe, maybe not.</p>

<p>Here is an issue that I ran into yesterday with &ldquo;<strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>&rdquo;. I suspect I&rsquo;m not alone in that situation.</p>

<p>The excellent website building tool, <strong>Universe</strong>, came out with an update that introduces <em>Sign-in with Apple</em>. After updating the application on my iPad, I launch the app. I&rsquo;m welcomed with a sign-in screen. The Sign-in with Apple option is prominently displayed. I tap on it. I&rsquo;m then presented with the typical panel to decide if I expose my real email address and my real name. Now the troubles begin.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already a user of <strong>Universe</strong>, which email did I use to create my initial account? I can&rsquo;t remember. What if I choose the wrong one? I try one of my email address that I decided to reveal. Hit sign-in; after a few seconds of working progress, I&rsquo;m met with welcome screen for new users. Duh. I&rsquo;m trying to get back, to no avail.</p>

<p>This issue reveals a big flaw in Sign in with Apple: when you are already a user of a service, switching to the more secure sign-in option makes it hard to associate this login to your existing account. I ran into the same issue with most of the services where I tried to make the switch. I suspect this is hindering the adoption of an otherwise secure upgrade to traditional authentication service. Too bad.</p>

<p>Yesterday Apple launched their latest service offering: Fitness+. I gave it a try, and I fell in love. The first step was to update all my supported devices: the iPhone, my Apple Watch and my Apple TV. After spending a few minutes glancing at the different type of workouts, I elected to do a twenty minutes treadmill workout using my iPhone and my AirPods Pro. For this session, Jamie-Ray was my coach. As you can see, I think I made pretty well. I liked everything about the experience, from onboarding to the actual workout session with on-screen feedbacks and the finale. The music choice was good too! After my session, I gave a look at the Apple TV Fitness application. Upon launching the app, you have to select the Apple Watch associated with the person who will interact with the service. One note, if your Apple Watch name is too long, spacing on the screen won‚Äôt allow you to easily see which Apple Watch is which; you‚Äôll have to wait so see the text to scroll, it‚Äôs a bit of an annoyance. I checked a few workout previews and sure enough, the video quality is exceptional on the Apple TV 4K.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a great start for Fitness+. It‚Äôs probably the best example of the whole being larger than the sum of its part. The combination of great devices, great content, great user experience, impeccable execution are the ingredients and enablers for the best experience. Bravo Apple.</p>

<p>Oh, I‚Äôll try to exercise five to six days a week.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the teams at Apple for putting this App privacy feature together. Just like food labels, application labels were long overdue. Apple is far from perfect, <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/09/23/the-rotten-side-of-tim-cooks-apple/">I wrote about that a few weeks ago</a>, but at the very least they do move the needle quite a bit.

<blockquote>You can learn a great deal from the unified log entries of a system startup, and that for an M1 Mac is even more fascinating for the insights it gives into the hardware in the M1 system-on-a-chip (SoC). These were obtained from an M1 MacBook Pro with 8 CPU cores and 8 GPU cores running macOS 11.0.1 fairly clean, and in full Secure Boot.</blockquote>

<p>I always liked low level stuff in computers. I learned 6502 assembly language (if we can call this a &ldquo;language&rdquo;) when I was a teenager. If you&rsquo;re into these type of things, it is a fascinating short read that opens the door to what is going on in your M1 Mac.</p>

<p>Who knew COVID-19 would have a very positive side effect on me. It started on March 13th of 2020, and it&rsquo;s still going on nearly uninterrupted. What is it? I have more time than ever to focus on my writing and publishing activities. Why?</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m working from home from mi-March of this year, I no longer have to commute. I save countless hours per week just because of this. On top of that, consider many activities on the weekend that no longer can take place because of the on-and-off restrictions in place.</p>

<p>I never wrote or published as much stuff in the last nine months as in the last year or so. I have a lot of projects in my head, small and more significant. I did spend quite a lot as I no longer travelling on software, services, work-from-home equipment. I also have more time for reading than before, it makes a difference.</p>

<p>COVID-19 is transformative at the society level but also a personal level. There are things that I don&rsquo;t want to return when COVID-19 is no longer among us. Time is a precious resource, once you have it, you don&rsquo;t want to mess with it.</p>

<blockquote>The '040 was a substantial upgrade over the '030 that had previously been used by Apple. It featured 1.2 million transistors, over four times as many as its predecessor. This processor increased the L1 cache size by a factor of eight to 4096 bytes, and it was the first 68k processor to have an on-board floating-point unit (FPU). While not without its drawbacks, the '040 processor was an obvious candidate for Apple's next line of premium workstations at the time. And this line would become known as ‚ÄúQuadra,‚Äù starting with the Quadra 700 and 900 models in late 1991.</blockquote>

<p>In 1990-1991, I was working for an Apple authorized dealer. I remember the Quadra line, in particular, the 700. It was the most popular machine among desktop publisher. It was fast. I liked its vertical and boxy look. It was different. What is interesting is the description of the Motorola 68040 processor. Compare this to the Apple Silicon, it&rsquo;s simply unbelievable. The M1 chip comes from an alien world.</p>

<p>Recently I spent more time than usual on YouTube for different reasons: to look at AirPods Max first impressions, to learn more about Synology DSM 7.0 beta, etc. After a while, it&rsquo;s easy to see a trend that bugs me: design uniformity across the board.

On top of that, there seems to be a trend where the weider you look, the better. When did that trend start?</p>

<p>Published by BasicAppleGuy, a <a href="https://www.basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/0-new-features">short survey of his experience with MacOS Snow Leopard</a>, back in 2009. I remember Steve Jobs talking about this release of MacOS as a pause in new features introduction in order to build the foundations for the next decade of MacOS (now spelled macOS). In fact, I would argue that, no new flashy feature was a new feature in itself. Something Apple could do these days. Their operating systems are muc more complex and feature rich, Apple is not standing still either. I cannot see them doing this.</p>

<p>For a while, I used to maintain a table of measures related to Apple that were in four categories: <em>Finance</em>, <em>Products</em>, <em>Expectations</em>, <em>Market Landscape</em>. Each attributes had his own ponderation. I wold give a scope from 0 to 10 on each of them. A formula would calculate something call the Health Index. I would revisit this table four times a year. It was obviously totally subjective but it was fun to do. Today, their score would be 9.140 out of 10. Not bad.</p>

<p>When you get an update from the App Store stating a size of, let&rsquo;s say 179.4 MB, this doesn&rsquo;t represent the actual amount of data that will be downloaded. In fact, depending of your device, the size will be much smaller. If you want to see this in action, turn on Low Data Mode. Then, go to the App Store and download an application update and look at the actual size of the download in the alert box. Tadam!</p>

<p>That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm hoping too. The iMac and the MacBook design in general were highly influenced by the thermal pressure the Intel chip was imposing.

Apple could have done to the written space what they did for the audio world with podcasts. Apple could have created a special place on Apple News for individual writers, not only bloggers per se. This would have been a message of inclusion, diversity and openess. Instead, Apple is again sending a message about begin a walled garden, exclusion, elitism. Too bad.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;m currently trying a few iOS or iPadOS apps on my M1 Mac mini. I came across the <strong>Castro Podcast</strong> player for with I pay a subscription. Castro doesn&rsquo;t support the iPad, yet, which is a bummer. On Big Sur, the application looks like what we used to have on very old versions of MacOS: Desk Accessories. Depending of your age, you&rsquo;ll know what I&rsquo;m talking about. I kind of like the use of small apps like this.

I can see people already calling out how absurd it is, and the lack of charger or any cables, bla bla bla. Put that aside and enjoy their lovely retro look. Oh, and since their ear cushion can be replaced, I guess they don&rsquo;t have to match the colour of the over-ear &ldquo;cups&rdquo;, right?&hellip; Lots of possibilities here. Shipping dates are already slipping in 2021&hellip; expect to see them everywhere next summer, when covid is behind us (most of it) and people can return to a simili normal life.</p>

         	<p>As an IT guy, looking at what Synology has in store for 2021 makes me pretty excited. I <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/12/07/massive-update-coming.html">wrote about that yesterday</a> but I took a deeper look at what is coming in DSM 7.0, their NAS operating system. I didn‚Äôt pay too much attention to their photo management software that comes with a Synology NAS, but that might change. <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/11/28/my-updated-blogger-workflow-as-of-2020-11/">In my blogger workflow</a>, there is something I can optimize is the use of a photo management to store all my screen shots, stock photos, visual assets, etc. Synology Photos could be the tool I was looking for for a long time. I don‚Äôt want to use Apple‚Äôs Photos application as I don‚Äôt really like to see screenshots intermixed with family pictures. If Synology Photos is as solid as it looks, if their mobile application is much improved to their current version, I‚Äôll certainly give it a serious try. On top of that, this photo feature also enable remote access to the photo library. Very interesting.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been shopping around for a home NAS for a long time and only made the plunge this year. After much thinking and reading, I settled on Synology because I saw a mature company offering mature products with a solid reputation. Again, DSM 7.0 brings a lot of new features and improvements which makes me feel happy about my choice of going with them. Can‚Äôt wait to try what‚Äôs new.</p>

I‚Äôm a big fan. I use it for archiving, space reclamation on my Mac and much more. It‚Äôs fast and reliable as I had a chance to test the repair feature after losing a hard drive (yes, already!). It worked flawlessly.</p>

<p>This week, Synology will make DSM 7.0 available for beta testers, the braves. Looking at <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/beta/DSM70Beta">the announcement web page</a>, it looks like a massive update. Refreshed screens, more cloud integration, admin rights delegation and added feature like Active Insight will certainly be exciting additions. One question: I think Synology is about to add a subscription for this, which I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll pay for, depending of its usefulness in its final form. We‚Äôll see.</p>

         	<p>See that UI of the iPhone when you receive a call while being on another with someone else? Pretty confusing, right? You stress out to understand what to do while hoping you‚Äôll have enough time to not miss the call. it is a stressful user experience. Why is Apple not giving any attention to this very specific UI is beyond me. They made notable change in iOS 14 with the notification-like interface for incoming calls, which was more than welcomed.</p>

<p>The way I came over this challenge is to concentrate on the icon labels instead of the icon itself. It does help a lot in my case.</p>

The device management UI also received a redesign. Some of the previously available information has been removed or moved around. CPU, Memory consumption and internal temperature are higher than before (around +10%-30%), though. Overall, its&rsquo;a solid update. Oh, and it is running an 4 cores ARM processor.</p>

Before answering this request, you have to look at your calendar to see your free/busy time. It&rsquo;s a time consuming and error prone process. What if your favorite calendaring app could generate a map of your weekly schedule with all sensible information masked out, like in the following example (made with Fantastical). This could be sent as a PDF file to the customer, would save a lot of time. It&rsquo;s surprising that, to my knowledge, no calendaring app offer this option. I would pay to get this.</p>

<em>‚ÄúIntel and AMD have learned and struggled for a few years here figuring out how to make decent PC chips. Apple hasn‚Äôt just magically figured this out. They‚Äôre not going to just walk in.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>It‚Äôs a liberal transposition of a famous quote on how Apple, a PC guy, just can‚Äôt walk in and make a great phone. With the M1 chip, yes, Apple just walked in and did it. Again.</p>

<p>Many pundits were quick to jump the gun on software compatibility issues, the translation layer called Rosetta, the meager 8 GB of RAM, the lack of ports, etc. As proven by the numerous independent reviews, none of these ‚Äúissues‚Äù are  affecting the value of what Apple just did.</p>

<p>It will take a few years before Intel and their friends finally realize what just happened in late 2020 and recover from it. <em>Years.</em></p>

         	<p>Steve Jobs once downplayed flash memory based MP3 players when the iPod was just beginning its ascension. We know what came after the iPod with a small drive. The iPod nano, an MP3 player using flash memory. If you see a stylus, they blew it. The iPad eventually came with support for a stylus&hellip; oops, a pencil. What came after that? Support for a mouse with iPadOS 13.4. See the trend? Are you getting it?</p>

<p>Now, about the Mac. Sure Apple could have used this historic moment to a add touch screen to the M1 MacBook. It didn‚Äôt happen. I, myself, was one of them, thinking it was about to happen as exposed <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/11/14/thoughts-on-one-more-thing-the-ultimate-mac-transition/">in this blog post</a>. My short experience with macOS Big Sur updated design screams out loud that we are far closer to a touch supported Mac than Apple is willing to admit.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know when, but it will come, in a perfectly chosen moment by Apple. Apple likes to move forward, one step at a time. The next window of opportunity is next year with a redesigned MacBook body. This year‚Äôs was about the internals while keeping familiarities: performance, battery life and transition. Next year is about redefining the way we look at the MacBook and enhance the way we always knew how to interact with it. The Big Sur update this year is just the first step toward a touch friendly operating system. In a typical Apple way, they will have thoroughly thought about all this and we will be amazed about why it wasn‚Äôt done this way before. Next year has the potential to be exciting.</p>

         	<p>In light of all the raving reviews about the M1-based Macs, you might wonder why someone would still need and buy an Intel-based Mac Pro? For many reasons. First, some high-demanding pro software might not be compatible on M1 Macs. Second, if you run software who takes advantage of multiple cores, the Mac Pro with its Xeon processor is hard to beat. Example of this is VMware Fusion. Other use cases demand the most powerful CPU you can get, and they come in the Mac Pro, for now. Third, the Mac Pro is still the most expandable Mac out there. I&rsquo;m one of those contemplating the Mac Pro for <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/29/the-sddcbox-project-part-3-choosing-a-mac-pro-configuration/">my SDDCbox project</a>, but I must say that my priorities shifted a bit.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Let‚Äôs put it straight: <strong>Apple‚Äôs Shortcuts</strong> are the weirdest, most cumbersome and utterly frustrating thing to build, test and eventually use. I cannot count how many hours I spent trying to understand their intricacies and most useful use cases. As much as I want to get empowered by them, it often ends in frustration. Here is why.</p>

<p>You cannot disable old shortcuts that are no longer used but that you want to keep as a reference.  There is no way to export them in a clean and readable PDF format. There is a lack of some form of runtime debugging tools. The editor doesn‚Äôt scale beyond a few dozens instructions. There is no way to write shortcuts in a text editor √† la AppleScript. Share sheets bad design and organization make shortcuts invocation a trial and error experience. As your shortcuts collection grows, it hard to remember which shortcut does what in what context and what is required to launch it. And the list goes on and on. Documentation within the Shortcuts editor is lacking, very limited. A big part of the story is dependant on the willingness of developers to support them. It‚Äôs so frustrating to see an app lacking any form of exposure to the shortcut engine.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, I like the idea of automation on the iPad or iPhone. I‚Äôm happy to see Apple improving on them with each release of their operating systems. But, there is so much left to cover.</p>

         	<p>Let&rsquo;s set the tone: Adobe software, Lightroom in particular, is not a very efficient piece of software to use on the Mac&hellip; even on a higher-end configuration. Recent updates in the last year or so tried to improve things a little bit, but there is still a long way to go. It&rsquo;s not clear why Lightroom Classic is so bad. Is it because it is a multi-platform software? Probably. If so, we pay the price at every single use.</p>

<p>Does the M1 chip in a Mac can change the game? Well, yes and no. The following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri8hKJKul5c&amp;feature=emb_title">YouTube video</a> compares Lightroom Classic running on an Intel-based MacBook Pro to an M1-based MacBook Pro. With Rosetta 2 translation layer running to support the non-optimized version of Lightroom Classic, we could think the experience would be awful. In fact, not only it isn&rsquo;t, the M1-based Mac makes the experience a bit better. Who would have thought.</p>

<p>Now, Adobe is working on a native or universal version of Lightroom for the M1 chip. Note that I&rsquo;m referring to Lightroom CC here, the cloud version of Lightroom, not the Classic version. Depending of who you are and what is your relation to photo processing, it may be a good or a bad news. Nonetheless, the prospect of a universal of Lightroom CC is certainly exciting. Will Adobe take advantage of the GPU cores or the ML cores of the M1 chip? I highly doubt it. If the iPad version of Lightroom CC is any indication, though, not all is lost. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

         	<p>Just bought a Mac utility: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/hazeover-distraction-dimmer/id430798174?mt=12">HazeOver</a>!
How come I didn&rsquo;t know about this one?? What is it? It&rsquo;s a small utility which helps bring better focus to the active application on your Mac. It does this by dimming the out-of-focus application windows. It works with multiple displays. If you prefer to work in Light mode over Apple&rsquo;s Dark Mode, it will make things a lot easier on your eyes. Think of it as a visual compromise. Makes Big Sur even better. Highly recommended.</p>

         	<p>Another excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/ssaig/status/1331879956272607236">Twitter thread about the M1 chip</a>. This time, it is a comparison with the AMD Ryzen. From a thermal design power, the M1 chip is simply unique and unmatched. On a per-core basis, top of the line AMD Ryzen chip and Apple&rsquo;s M1 chip are of equal performance. On top of that, the M1 chip is much more than a standard CPU. Oh, and it is only the beginning. Who thought 2020 was such a bad year.</p>

         	<p>In a <a href="https://beckyhansmeyer.com/2020/11/25/your-move-ipad/#comments">blog post</a> &ldquo;Your Move, iPad&rdquo;, by Becky Hansmeyer, the author asks <em>&ldquo;So if raw power isn‚Äôt enough, and new display tech isn‚Äôt enough, where does the iPad go from here? Will it be abandoned once more, lagging behind the Mac in terms of innovation, or will Apple continue to debut its latest tech in this form factor?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>In light of the massively successful M1-powered Macs, what can we infer for the future of the iPad Pro?</strong></p>

<p>Apple doesn&rsquo;t need to add touchscreen to their MacBook line if they unleash the iPad with a much more complete iPadOS experience. I think Apple missed the occasion with iPadOS 14 by not adding a more flexible widgets experience, by refusing to improve external display support and by not revisiting the multitasking interaction model. See? It&rsquo;s not only a matter of adding 5G wireless support or LiDAR or a second USB-C port. These will only be as good as the software will allow them to be useful. The just begun new era for Mac with the M1 chip combined with Apple&rsquo;s tight software integration should give us answers on why the iPad Pro future lies in the software.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Here is a super fascinating Twitter thread that I reproduce here. Find the <a href="https://twitter.com/erratarob/status/1331735383193903104?s=21">original tweets here</a>. It&rsquo;s is about Apple Silicon wizardry. For techy people only!</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;In case you were wondering: Apple&rsquo;s replacement for Intel processors turns out to work really, really well. Some otherwise skeptical techies are calling it &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It runs Intel code extraordinarily well. The basic reason is that Arm and Intel architectures have converged. Yes, the instruction sets are different, but the underlying architectural issues have become very similar. The biggest hurdle was &ldquo;memory-ordering&rdquo;, the order in which two CPUs see modifications in memory by each other. It&rsquo;s the biggest problem affecting Microsoft&rsquo;s emulation of x86 on their Arm-based &ldquo;Surface&rdquo; laptops. So Apple simply cheated. They added Intel&rsquo;s memory-ordering to their CPU. When running translated x86 code, they switch the mode of the CPU to conform to Intel&rsquo;s memory ordering. With underlying architectural issues ironed out, running x86 code simply means translating those instructions to the Arm equivalent. This is very efficient and results in code that often runs at the same speed. Sometimes there isn&rsquo;t a direct equivalent, so the translation results in slightly slower code, but benchmarks show x86 being consistently at least 70% of the speed. In any case, a surprising number of popular apps already run on it. Apple seeded developer systems a few months back, allowing people to get their code ready. Normally, that wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough time. When you recompile code for a new architecture, it usually breaks. But as I said above: Arm and Intel architectures have converged enough that code is much less likely to break, making recompiling easier. Apple has made surprising choices. They&rsquo;ve optimized JavaScript, with special JavaScript-specific instructions, double sized L1 caches, and probably other tricks I don&rsquo;t know of. Thus, as you browse the web, their new laptop will seem faster and last longer on battery, because JavaScript, even though other benchmarks show it roughly the same speed as Intel/AMD. The older MacBook Air had a dual core CPU that ran at 3.8 GHz, but when in low-power mode, 1.2 GHz. Switching between fast and slow modes is how it conserves power for mobile. But it&rsquo;s ultimately inefficient. The Intel CPU is designed to run at 5 GHz. Downclocking to 1 GHz saves power &ndash; but not as much as if you&rsquo;d designed the processor to run at 1 GHz to begin with. Apple&rsquo;s strategy is to use two processors: one designed to run fast above 3 GHz, and the other to run slow below 2 GHz. Apple calls this their &ldquo;performance&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. Each optimized to be their best at their goal. When they need to conserve power, they turn off the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; processors and run code on their &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. They have 4x performance processors (twice that of their older Macs) plus 4x efficiency processors. All 8 can be active. When doing something that can use 8 processors, such as compiling code, it goes real REAL fast. 8 processors vs. 2 processors in their old notebooks make a difference. A big part of this story is that Intel is about 3 years behind on Moore&rsquo;s Law. Apple Silicon uses the latest 5nm tech from TMSC, while Intel uses the older 10nm/7nm generation. Much of Intel&rsquo;s product line uses the even older 14nm/10nm generation. None of this is actual &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all pretty understandable. It&rsquo;s just all the various things have been executed really well, leading to a combined result that is a great leap forward. Another &ldquo;magic&rdquo; trick is how their &ldquo;Swift&rdquo; programming language uses &ldquo;reference counting&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;garbage collection&rdquo; in Android. They did something in their CPU to double the speed of reference counting. &hellip;even when translating x86 code, all that reference counting overhead (already more efficient than garbage collection) gets dropped in half. Yet another weird performance enhance to add to all the others.&rdquo;</em></p>

I must say that&rsquo;s a quite different and ordinary one compared to previous years. It&rsquo;s no longer about touching hearts but just having fun and selling you something. This doesn&rsquo;t reasonate as much with me as it used to. Contrary to previous years, Apple is focusing on one product, the HomePod mini. Again, I prefer when they don&rsquo;t try to sell us something this way. There is plenty of other companies who do just that. Please, Apple, no.</p>

It is inevitable. Apple‚Äôs focus this year was on the internals but I expect them to switch to the outside on the next iterative evolution of the Mac mini. Besides physical compatibility reasons, a much smaller Mac mini, close to the size of an Apple TV for example could be in store. One possible constrain is the number of ports Apple will have to squeeze on the back. If they keep the same number of ports, the newly redesigned Mac mini could be something in-between the current one and the Apple TV. We‚Äôll see. Meanwhile, I‚Äôll patiently wait for my own M1-based Mac mini to arrive in 28 days. Its external size won‚Äôt matter much to me.</p>

<p>Widgets came to Android in 2008-2009. What am I missing here? How ironic is this? A lot if you ask me. I&rsquo;m not calling out Notion, far from it.

         	<p>A lot has been written on Apple switch to their own processors already. But one side of the story is still lacking some insight. Apple is probably saving a lot of money by putting their own Apple silicon in each Mac they sell. According to <a href="https://sumitgup.medium.com/why-did-apple-build-their-own-arm-m1-cpu-chip-2fdd88db9b36">this Medium article</a>, Apple could save at least $2 billion a year with just three entry level MacBook sporting the M1 chip. We can only try to approximate the amount of money Apple is no longer paying to Intel. We can also start wondering the amount of money Apple has directly invested in developing the M1 chip and how fast they wil recoup their investments. My gut feeling says that it will be fast.</p>

         	<p>Here is a simple theory. This year&rsquo;s MacBook didn&rsquo;t bring an upgrade to the FaceTime HD camera, and unanimously, people is complaining. But what if this lack of attention to the very specific feature from Apple is part of a bigger plan for next year&rsquo;s MacBook? Here is my guess.</p>

<p>Apple is targeting next year for the real deal: the full redesign of the MacBook line to be announced around WWDC 2021. Part of this plan would include much better FaceTime HD camera assembly that would include Face ID, a highly expected feature for M1-based machines. Offered in sizes of 12&rdquo;, 14&rdquo; and 16&rdquo; with an impossibly thin screen bezel, Apple wanting to keep the size of these machines the smallest possible as the power sipping CPU can handle smaller batteries yet providing long battery life. I would expect the M1x chip as the more powerful M2 one would go to the iMac, iMac Pro. The new MacBook, to be named MacBook X, will will mark the first year of the Apple silicon transition.</p>

<p>Until then, keep enjoying your Apple Silicon Mac, version 1.</p>

         	<p>After months of silence, I&rsquo;m finally getting some response from Apple regarding my submission to publish on <strong>Apple News</strong>. I can&rsquo;t remember when I first submitted my Numeric Citizen Blog for publication on the Apple News platform. In a unexpected twist, they got in touch with me and asked to fill a questionnaire, which I promptly did. They are putting a new review process in place. I also updated my selection of articles submitted for review to use more recent ones. We&rsquo;ll see how fast they respond and if they open the gate!</p>

         	<p>Many are asking if they should go with a 16 GB RAM configuration for their new M1-based MacBook Air. Some others think Apple should have made a 32 GB of RAM configuration for the 13‚Äù MacBook Pro. According to this <a href="https://youtu.be/Tq3Zc8jmf0Y">informal benchmarking video</a>, 8 GB seems enough for most people. During his tests, the user opened many different apps and documents in Excel, tabs in Chrome, Photoshop and the MacBook Air stayed cool and never ever started to fall on its knees. At no time the idle CPU metric went down below 60%. The fan-less computer never got hot. Why? Three letters: SoC.</p>

<p>The M1 chip gathers many different components close together on the same chip so they don&rsquo;t have to go through the PCI bus to move data around. I think it plays a big role in Apple Silicon Macs efficiency. We can no longer compare the RAM configuration of an Apple Mac with a Wintel machine, just like we cannot compare a 12 GB of RAM Android phone to a 6 GB of RAM iPhone. It&rsquo;s just two different worlds.</p>

<p>Yet, I ordered a 16 GB Mac mini. üò≥</p>

Third, Pixelmator Pro is close to how Apple&rsquo;s own apps should be designed. Make no mistake, I love Apple&rsquo;s iWork. Pixelmator feels familiar and Apple-ish, something that I like. They probably read the HIG documentation dozen of times. Congrats to them.</p>

         	<p>Here is what I&rsquo;m hoping to see from reviewers of the M1-based Macs today. How fast is the machine booting? Is wake from sleep that much better? When you start a non-optimized app, how does Rosetta 2 kicks in? How long does it take? What happens when you start the same app a second time after a while? Was Rosetta kick out and has to relaunch? How is window resizing doing, we know that was never really fast on Intel-based machines. How is scrolling speed in Photos? Can you really feel the difference on an optimized app compared to their Intel counterpart? Does installing 11.0.1 update was faster than on previous macOS release on Intel? Is the Mac mini the fastest among the three? Does GPU intensive tasks are really that much faster? What about SSD speed for reads and writes compared to an Intel Mac? is it much improved? Is macOS Big Sur buggier than on Intel? Is 8 GB of RAM enough or 16 GB is really a must? Have you tried Pixelmator Pro, how fast is it now?</p>

         	<p>In light of Apple&rsquo;s recent products introduction, consider the recently introduced <strong>Microsoft Surface Go</strong>. A Windows laptop that starts with 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB SSD, 12.4‚Äù touch screen using the Intel Core i5 which will get you 13 hours on battery for 550$. If you want a 8 GB of RAM, 256 GB SSD, the price goes up to 899$, but you keep the same lame CPU.</p>

<p>Now, compare this to the new MacBook Air (a much more powerful laptop) for 899$ (education pricing), same amount of RAM and SSD, 5 hours more of battery life, a much better non-touch display.</p>

<p>How is Microsoft supposed to compete against Apple in this market now?</p>

<p>They simply can‚Äôt, and they should start to worry.</p>

         	<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong with my perception of the disaster Apple created with the introduction of widgets in combination with notifications center (read <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/11/01/im-done-with.html">my comment here on micro.blog</a>). After reading the excellent <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macos-big-sur-the-macstories-review/">MacStories.net review of Big Sur</a>, I finally saw the combination in action. Notifications are see big improvements and look closer to what we get on iOS.</p>

<p>Still, Apple lost the opportunity to make widgets available in their own space, something like what we used to have, the Dashboard. It&rsquo;s ridiculous to confine widgets in such a small space, considering modern screen sizes. Oh, and I hope the interaction feels much more fluid on M1-based machines because the last time checked on a 2017 MacBook Pro, with Big Sur beta 10, it was super laggy</p>

         	<p>Twitter is ablaze since yesterday when first benchmarks of the MacBook Air were published. They show the M1-based and fan-less Mac to surpass the top of the line iMac! It‚Äôs impressive if not mind-blowing!</p>

<p>Now here is a simple theory: native apps will certainly perform really well but non-native apps will run under the Rosetta layer, which happens to consume CPU cycles. This performance room being consumed by Rosetta, the actual performance of a non native app will probably fall down to a more reasonable level.</p>

<p>Impressive nonetheless.</p>

         	<p>Here is the thing: the new M1-based Macs use the new &ldquo;<strong>unified memory architecture</strong>‚Äù that is at the center of our iPhones and iPads. If you plan to buy one of these shinny new Mac, my recommendation would be to go with 16 GB of RAM, not 8 GB. Why? Consider this: Rosetta 2 is a new emulation software layer that will consume memory, something that is not present on Intel-based machines. On top of that, memory will be consume for video processing. My guess is: the biggest monitoring, the higher the resolution, the more memory will be consumed. What‚Äôs left for the applications? Even if SSD is fast on reads and writes, application launches are fast, nothing equals the speed of RAM. I&rsquo;m afraid 8 GB of RAM is the new meager 5 GB iCloud storage tier for M1-based Mac. We&rsquo;ll see with the upcoming reviews and benchmarks.</p>

         	<p>From rewatching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghdTqnYnFyg&amp;feature=share">Steve Jobs announcing Apple&rsquo;s transition to Intel processors</a>, here are a few interesting observations, just in time for tomorrow‚Äôs #AppleEvent.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs reminds the crowd of transitions in Mac history: 68K to PowerPC, OS 9 to OS 10 then introduces the third transition: going to Intel. Each time, he uses the expression ‚Äúto set Apple for the next 10 years&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all about the CPU roadmap‚Äôs ability to enable the Apple&rsquo;s vision. Also, even at that time, power consumption was an issue. He also repeatedly mention great updates still coming to the PowerPC-based Macs.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for tomorrow‚Äôs version of the very same playbook.</p>

         	<p>This quote from the Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s review of the <strong>iPhone 12 Pro Max</strong> is priceless as ti summarize one of the biggest issue, in my opinion, about Apple‚Äôs current state of its software in general:</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúIt is crazy to me, however, that Apple hasn&rsquo;t enabled us to do more on a phone that is practically iPad-size. Why can&rsquo;t I view my inbox on the top half of the screen and my calendar on the bottom, like Samsung allows with its Multi-Window mode? Why does the tiny iPhone Mini allow the same number of rows of home-page app icons and widgets as the iPhone Giant? Why can&rsquo;t I use an Apple Pencil to take notes on the notebook-size device?‚Äù</em></p>

<p>These are all valid questions. Even before the iPhone 12 Pro Max, these questions were valid. Software, like for the iPad, is holding back the iPhone. Is it a ressources issue being spread too thin? Is it something about product differentiation? I hope the answer is the former, not the latter.</p>

         	<p>Apple launched a <a href="https://experience.apple/iphone">webpage</a> to experience the selection and visualization of different MagSafe cases and wallets for the iPhone 12. I played with it for fun from my iPad Pro. It‚Äôs an interesting way to try different combinaisons of iPhone, cases and wallet in a world where going to a real store to do the same is challenging.</p>

<p>This year‚Äôs iPhone and cases prove to be hardly satisfactory, though. The colours options are not really in line to my tastes. After spending a while, I found two probable configurations that I would buy if I was on the market for such things. Because of bad reviews of the wallet, I would skip this one as I would fear losing my three most important cards. I hope Apple will fix the issues with next year‚Äôs round of the products.</p>

         	<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/leaksapplepro/status/1322608644928790528?s=21">recent tweet</a> from @LeaksApplePro made me think about the significance of the iPhone 12 in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>Apple is about to remove the last port on the iPhone, so they are training us with the MagSafe. Next year‚Äôs version will fix many of the issue we‚Äôre facing today. 5G may not be ready, but next year it will be much better. LiDAR is fascinating, but next year we will depend on it. We tend to forget about the notch, next year it will be Apple who will forget it by putting it to rest.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre still in the middle of the pandemic. We‚Äôre not out of the woods. We‚Äôll continue to work from home for a long time. Trips are not really a thing right now. But, in the fall of 2021, can we hope that most of this will be behind us and return to normal life? It would help a lot to enjoy the portless iPhone 13 or whatever stupid name they will name it. Right now, I‚Äôm a bit tired of not being able to go out and use the cameras to build my visual memories.</p>

<p>The iPhone 12 is the transition iPhone that will lead us to a better world, a year from now. I hope.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The Mac has gone through many transitions in the past and I was there for each of them. From the Motorola CPU, to the PowerPC and the Intel processors, Apple‚Äôs execution was almost flawless.</p>

<p>At the upcoming Apple Event, Apple will unveil their highly anticipated Apple Silicon Macs. When thinking about what Apple could do for this pivotal moment for the Mac, there is two possible roads Apple can take in regards to the general design of these machines.</p>

<p>First, Apple could choose to do the same they did when they switched to Intel processors back in 2005. Apple kept the same designs. There are a few advantages to this approach. By going the conservative way, Apple sends a &ldquo;don‚Äôt worry, this is a Mac, everything will work just fine‚Äù message. This would probably helps keep the confidence level about the expected compatibility of these machines with current software. But there is one big drawback from a marketing standpoint: Apple chose to switch to its own CPU in order to enable new things on the Mac that wasn&rsquo;t possible before. I&rsquo;m not sure that keeping the same external design of the Mac is the best way to do it; it would be too conservative.</p>

<p>The second approach, the one that I prefer, would be for Apple to introduce a refreshed and modernized design. This could take the form of new materials, new textures, new tones. Screen bezels could be dramatically reduced in order to bring the machine down in size. On top of that, better FaceTime camera with 4K resolution, always-on Siri could also make their debuts. If battery life can show major improvements, Apple would have a winner here. Such a move by Apple would help mark the turning point for the Mac, a new era, just like they did in 2012 when they introduced the unibody design. The Mac is in need of such refresh and this is the right time to do it.</p>

<p>If <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/05/2-5m-apple-silicon-macbooks-by-february-2021/?utm_source=osx&amp;utm_medium=push&amp;utm_campaign=">Apple is really aiming to produce 2.5 million Apple Silicon MacBooks by February 2021</a>, there has to be something special besides a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/05/a14x-bionic-allegedly-benchmarked-days-before-apple-silicon-mac-event">powerful and power efficient A14X CPU</a>. Let&rsquo;s see which strategy Apple decided to chose.</p>

<p>Side note: it is fascinating to see that the PC never went through these transitions like the Mac did. It is something unique in the technology world. No other company ever did this, that many times. Now, we might wonder if this Apple Silicon transition will spark a similar move in the Wintel world. Why? Because Intel is no longer a synonym of real platform evolution, ARM-based design is.</p>

         	<p>In the last few weeks, I repeatedly got a simple question regarding the <strong>Apple Watch: does it require an iPhone</strong>? One person expected to &ldquo;pair‚Äù the watch with an iPad. The other is an Android user. These questions tell me something interesting. One, the Apple Watch is gaining traction among non-Apple users. Two, the quicker Apple can remove the iPhone requirement to get an Apple Watch, the better it will be for their bottom line. This could be something as important as the iTunes for Windows was back in the days.</p>

         	<p>Here‚Äôs a quick and unrelated question: how old, on average, are people who love the design language of macOS Big Sur? Seriously, my bet goes to a much younger crowd than those who prefer macOS Catalina. Why? People who grew up with the iPhone and iPadOS has a much different design reference frame that those who grew up with macOS. The latter group seems to see Big sur as some sort of iPadification of macOS.</p>

         	<p>Surprising rumors by Bloomberg about Apple working on a new Mac Pro, about half the size of the current model:</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúApple engineers are currently developing a new Mac Pro that looks like the current design at about half the size. It‚Äôs unclear if that Mac will replace the current Mac Pro or if it‚Äôs an additional model.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>As someone who is seriously contemplating to buy a Mac Pro, this information makes me pause a bit.

         	<p>There is a difference between what I expect and what are the things that I would really like to see. Here is a short list for this last Apple Event of 2020.</p>

<p>I hope for an Apple Silicon Mac with a full physical redesign of the Mac it is replacing. The re-introduction of the 12&rdquo; MacBook with a refreshed design language, something that would be start of something new for all the upcoming MacBook updates in the future. I want Apple to mark the beginning of a new era for the Mac, not something in the form of continuity. I want Apple to turn the page and move beyond the Jony Ive&rsquo;s era. Let&rsquo;s start fresh, be forward thinking. Go past Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface. Oh, this brings me to another wish: Touch support on macOS Big Sur and Apple Silicon Mac. Signs are pointing to this. That would be the real kicker of this year. Please, Apple, make it so. Impress me.</p>

         	<p>Big surprise today, it came early, Apple sent their invites for a November 10th Apple event. Rumours were pointing to November 17th date. Happy the wait will be shorter than anticipated.</p>

<p>I love this tag line; it was used at many occasions by Steve Jobs to show something that could be a game changer or of high significance.</p>

<p>This early invite adds credence to those who think macOS Big Sur 11.0 is already being put on unreleased new Macs. Expect 11.0.1 to follow pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Here is what&rsquo;s on the menu for this last Apple event of 2020.</p>

<ul>
<li>macOS 11.0 &ldquo;Big Sur&rdquo; make its official debuts (100%)</li>
<li>Universal apps running simultaneously on iOS, iPadOS and macOS are now supported (100%)</li>
<li>First round of Apple Silicon Macs are release: MacBook or MacBook Pro (100%)</li>
<li>Side announcements of updated configurations for 21.5‚Äù iMac and 27‚Äù iMac Pro still on Intel (70%)</li>
<li>Apple TV refresh using Apple Silicon and new game controller (40%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for next week.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>According to <a href="https://appletrack.org/many-13-macbook-pro-21-5-imac-models-out-of-stock-ahead-of-rumored-november-event/">AppleTrack.org</a>, there is a shortage of many different Mac models. Some shipping dates are slipping into December. It the case for the 21.5‚Äù iMac and iMac Pro. Troubling.</p>

<p>When Apple announced they were transitioning their Macs to use the new Apple Silicon, they also said they would keep updating current Intel-based models for a while. I don&rsquo;t know this will translate in reality. If the iMac Pro is being updated this month, it could be for an updated configuration with an Intel CPU, not an Apple Silicon. The case of the 21.5‚Äù iMac is more interesting, tough. The 27‚Äù iMac was updated recently but not the 21.5. I&rsquo;m not sure it is the first prime candidate for the Apple Silicon. I&rsquo;m thinking more about the MacBook or the MacBook Pro which would highly benefit from the Apple Silicon.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the Mac Pro is still in stock. This could signal that it won&rsquo;t get updated this fall. The Mac Pro wasn&rsquo;t updated since its release in 2019. As I&rsquo;m looking to get one for <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/25/the-sddcbox-project-part-1-an-introduction/">my SDDCbox project</a>, I&rsquo;d would love to see a refreshed configuration in time for me to consider and pickup.</p>

         	<p>One of my favorite macOS utilities, <strong>iStat Menus</strong>, just received an update to version 6.5 which adds support for <strong>macOS Big Sur</strong>.

<p>iStat Menus will be ready when I&rsquo;m doing the switch to this Mac Pro for <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/25/the-sddcbox-project-part-1-an-introduction/">my SDDCbox project</a>. It will play an important role in giving me insights on the CPU and SSD access. For now, there are a lot of tweaks which will make this utility even better. Even their release notes is art!</p>

<p>There seems to be less and less high-quality apps and utilities like this these days&hellip;</p>

Judging from it, if I could summarize the iPhone 12 Pro photographic advances, it would be like this. The iPhone 12 Pro improvements are mostly about edge cases because in normal situations, improvements are much more subtle. The addition of Night Mode on the Ultra wide camera is part of features uniformisation across cameras which is welcomed, though.</p>

Maybe. ¬†I‚Äôve played with the new version a bit and really like the new design which is cleaner and more enjoyable to use.

         	<p>I‚Äôm always impressed by the turn over speed of major new releases of iOS. iOS 14 adoption rate is already surpassing iOS 13 after less than six weeks of availability. Wow.</p>

<p>Apple‚Äôs iPhone ecosystem is running at blazing speed to adopt new technologies. There is nothing like that in tech. Even if people are keeping their old iPhone longer, by supporting old devices, Apple can set the bar for new privacy features and make them available to a vast portion of the users. This is something we rarely talk about.</p>

Now, in the age of smartphones, what is the relevancy for Apple Silicon Macs? Why now? What pain points do they address? Can&rsquo;t wait for November.

<p>If there is one reason why Apple should get out of this deal and build their own search tech or buy DuckDuckGo altogether: put the walk behind the talk.</p>

         	<p>_‚ÄúEnduring design doesn‚Äôt need constant reinterpretation. It needs tweaking, polishing, and subtle improvement‚Äù  _‚Äî Om Malik</p>

<p>Great take by Om Malik on the the significance of timeless design in ‚Äú<a href="https://om.co/2020/10/23/iphone-12-and-why-great-design-is-timeless/">Why great design is timeless</a>‚Äù. As I wrote in <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/10/25/apple-did-it.html">my previous post</a>, to me, the iPhone 5 was the best Apple design before the iPhone 12. Om Malik refers to the iPhone 4 as being an example of timeless design that was later only tweaked, refined and polished in following iPhone iterations. I find it a bit surprising as the iPhone 4 metallic edges never really came back after the iPhone 4S.</p>

<p>Looking back at the iPhone design genealogy, we can infer six major groups of iPhone design language: the original iPhone up to the iPhone 3GS is group #1, the iPhone 4 and 4S is group #2, the iPhone 5, 5S and SE is group #3, the iPhone 6 and 6S is group #4,  the group #5 encompasses the iPhone 7 up to the iPhone 11 including the SE 2. Finally, group #6 is the iPhone 12. I expect Apple to iterate within that group for at least another year.</p>

<p>The iterative polishing, refining process of Apple is in full glory since the iPhone 7. The latter is heavily based on the iPhone 5 heritage. The iPhone 12 is heavily inspired by the iPhone 5 era and the group #5 of designs.</p>

<p>If Apple plays their card well, next year&rsquo;s iPhone could surpass this year&rsquo;s line up by fixing the Pro glossy edges, removing the notch (it won&rsquo;t happen), thinner bezels and less controversial colours selection, just to name a few attributes.</p>

         	<p>In my opinion, this year&rsquo;s black iPhone 12 is now their best design of all time, surpassing their previously best design, the black iPhone 5. It took them 8 years. I can&rsquo;t wait to see that in person, for now, <a href="https://twitter.com/bmacadelic/status/1319793464389894146?s=21">this tweet by Brian MacDuff</a> is enough to convince me. Blacks are deep blacks, the edges mat finish is way better than on the Pro models. What could come next to beat this? A notch-less design. Maybe next year or in 8 years. Who knows.

         	<p>In a surprising move, Airbnb has a new partnership with Apple&rsquo;s former designer chief, Jony Ive. As much as I like this guy‚Äôs work, something quite surprising struck me: Airbnb doesn&rsquo;t sell any form of hardware. The last time I check, Jony Ive‚Äôs reputation is not about crafting the best user interface designs in the world, far from it. Who remember the switch to iOS 7? I do. Jony Ive was quite instrumental in the design of iOS 7 and it was a disaster. We are still paying the price today. It will be interesting to watch what comes from this partnership.

         	<p>My possible future Mac Pro configuration is taking shape. It all <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/10/18/a-wild-dream.html">started here</a> btw. Reading carefully the spec sheet, the base configuration sets the memory clock speed at 2666 MHz while the 12 cores CPU configuration is at 2933 MHz. Considering my use case, virtualization with VMware Fusion, I&rsquo;ll take any non-GPU improvements possible. Speaking of GPU, I&rsquo;m not sure about the performance difference between the base GPU card, a AMD Radeon Pro 580X, and the more powerful AMD Radeon Pro W5500X. I&rsquo;ll probably keep the entry-level one saving memory for a bigger SSD. Maybe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not close yet to make the plunge and I&rsquo;ll have to wait for November announcements as configuration updates, price changes or something else could greatly affect my buying decision. Stay tuned for update #3.</p>

         	<p>With the iPhone 12 and MagSafe, is Apple training us for a port-less iPhone 13? I think so. The removable of the Lightning port and skipping USB-C would be so Apple, an act of courage I guess. If they do remove all the ports from the iPhone, how do we deal with CarPlay? What about developers who use testing and development devices which requires the fastest transfer speed possible? Is there something in the works at Apple that would mitigates these challenges for the users? Another type of adaptor? Or maybe Apple is just waiting for a more drastic iPhone redesign (no notch?) to bend themselves to USB-C?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I‚Äôve been thinking of something really wild recently, for me at least: <strong>replacing my 2017 21.5 inches iMac with a Mac Pro</strong>. Here is why.</p>

<p>I work in IT (information technologies) as a data center related technology architect. Server virtualization, storage area networks, networking technologies are at the center of my professional universe. In the coming months, I‚Äôll have to invest in self-training and experimentations a lot around VMware-related products and services. How can I do that efficiently while working from home? Here comes the Mac Pro idea.</p>

<p>In order to be able to run many virtual machines, a powerful physical computer is required: lots of memory, powerful CPU (more than 6 cores) and fast storage. My current iMac doesn‚Äôt meet these basic requirements (it is maxed out at 32 GB of RAM and it has a relatively modest CPU). A Mac Pro with the following specs would easily meet the challenge: at least 128 GB of fast memory, 8 cores CPU, builtin SSD and expandability.</p>

<p>Virtualization will required VMware Fusion Pro running on top of macOS. Then, the sky is the limit as I can then install ESXi hypervisor which will allow me to branch into more complex setup. This type of environment do require a lot of memory (a typical VM is about 4-16 GB each) and multi-cores CPU. Installing ESXi directly on the Mac Pro is not an option as I will need to have macOS running for all other tasks (I‚Äôm not even sure if it is att all possible).</p>

<p>How do I get there? Well, I‚Äôm still thinking about how I‚Äôll buy that machine and get the additional RAM (I won‚Äôt go with Apple‚Äôs because $$$). Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Technical datasheet can be found on Apple‚Äôs website, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/mac-pro/pdf/Mac_Pro_White_Paper_Feb_2020.pdf">right here in PDF format</a>. I don‚Äôt want to switch to a Windows machine BTW, I‚Äôm too much invested in Apple‚Äôs ecosystem for that to happen.</p>

        <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/10/17/a-follow-up.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-10-17 15:07:17 -0400">Oct 17, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In a recent blog post, the well known blogger and content creator, Matt Birchler, wants to understand why so many people are opting for emails (newsletters) over the web. I want to give my perspective on each of his questions.</p>

<p><em><strong>What about writing in a newsletter is more enjoyable than writing for a blog?</strong></em></p>

<p>My <em><a href="https://numericcitizen.substack.com">Numeric Citizen Introspection</a></em> newsletter is a monthly one. I start writing the next issue at the beginning of each month. I hit ‚ÄúPublish and send‚Äù at the very end of each month. It gives me four weeks to nurture its content. When the end of the month approaches, the newsletter content is mostly complete and I like how it evolved from the beginning. It is a satisfying process. Then, I take a pause and look forward to start the next one. I like the regular beat of all this process. I wouldn‚Äôt do a weekly newsletter, though, as it requires much more time to do.</p>

<p><em><strong>Are newsletter audiences more engaged than blog subscribers?</strong></em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure about this one in general. For me, it is too early to tell. My gut feeling is that people are more or less engaged the same way as they are with blogs. I‚Äôd like to be wrong, though, and have people engage more with newsletters.</p>

<p><em><strong>As a reader, do you prefer reading in your email app to an RSS app (or just the web in general)?</strong></em></p>

<p>I use Substack to build and send my newsletters. Each of them are also available via an RSS feed. Depending of the client used, the reading experience can be enjoyable on both type of clients. Personally, I do subscribe to Hey and reading newsletters with their client is really nice and provides a nice clipping feature which is very handy.</p>

<p><em><strong>Do you not miss things like link posts and ‚Äúgoing viral‚Äù which are much harder, if impossible to do with emails?</strong></em></p>

<p>Link posts can be done in newsletters and they won‚Äôt go viral for sure. But, I‚Äôm not really looking for this kind of fame to be honest.</p>

<p><em><strong>Is it easier to get people to sign up for a paid subscription compared to the web?</strong></em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm still building this stuff and my newsletter is free for now. I get new subscribers regularly but not as much as I would like. I guess I still have to get the word out and be more ‚Äúfamous‚Äù.</p>

         	<p>For the first time in my numeric life (at least, from what I‚Äôm aware of), one of my article has been robbed by another guy. After discovering it, I asked for immediate removal but without success. So, today, I‚Äôm calling him out.</p>

<p>The robbed article is the one about upgrading from an Apple Watch Series 4 to Series 6 <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/03/upgrading-from-an-apple-watch-series-4-to-series-6/">published on my main blog on October 3 of 2020</a> and on Medium. You can see <a href="https://www.duggu24.com/upgrading-from-an-apple-watch-series-4-to-series-6/">the stolen article there</a>. This article was then pushed on <a href="https://twitter.com/iamketyperry/status/1316023257884053511?s=21">this fake Twitter account</a> with 1628 followers. This Twitter account is apparently owned or operated <a href="https://twitter.com/duggu24?s=21">by this guy, the thieve</a> who is following four people and has only one follower (poor guy).</p>

<p>This hosting website seems to enjoy quite a bit of traffic. Good for him. All his articles is stolen stuff without any mention of the source. He must be proud of himself, I wonder if his parents are, though?</p>

<p>The main take out: I‚Äôm must be a good writer after all so people are starting to notice and copy my stuff.</p>

         	<p>As great looking and powerful the shinny new iPhone 12 Pro might be, I&rsquo;ll skip the upgrade this year. Sure, I tend to skip a few generations but there is one unexpected reason not to do so and another one more obvious. First, the problem is because of the current pandemic, I cannot see when I&rsquo;ll return traveling around the world. Traveling is the best photography opportunity for me. Without travel, working from home all the time, there is no need to get the latest smartphone technology. Second, 5G networks maybe powerful, but the coverage is spotty at best. I prefer to wait a year for this coverage to increase before making the jump on the new iPhone.</p>

         	<p>Yesterday, just like mostly everyday since March 13th of 2020, I went for a long walk with my wife. Both of us had their AirProds Pro with us. I had the idea to try the audio sharing feature of iOS 14 (introduced in iOS 13 if I&rsquo;m not mistaken). We both put our AirPods in and I selected a playlist. Then, using the media playback UI, I selected the audio sharing option, waited for my wife&rsquo;s AirPods to show up, after tapping this pair, she then had to accept my invitation and voil√†! We both had music in our ears! It‚Äôs a great case of ‚ÄúIt Just Works‚Äù, something that we see less and less often these days, I guess.</p>

         	<p>The rising popularity of paid newsletters is good news for many reasons. First, it&rsquo;s a signal that people are willing to pay for great content without ads all around it. Second, some people value the direct relationship feeling with the writer compared to a traditional website. Third, the popularity of independent writing is rising which is giving back control to the writers.</p>

<p>In a recent article by Nick Heer on Pixel Envy, the author writes:</p>

<p><em>Yet, despite all of these clear advantages, I still find it difficult to think of my email inbox as somewhere I will go to find something enjoyable to read.</em></p>

<p>I find newsletters a wonderful medium that cut the noise from social networks. The reading experience can further be improved with a great email client like Basecamp&rsquo;s Hey which provides a specific reading mode for newsletters call The Feed. You can read my review of this email client <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/07/24/my-thoughts-on-hey-and-why-im-paying-for-emails-in-2020/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Read more comments from Mr. Heer in his <a href="https://pxlnv.com/blog/paid-email-newsletters/">blog post</a>. <a href="https://numericcitizen.substack.com/p/finding-my-newsletter-purpose">I started a newsletter a few weeks ago</a>. For now and the foreseeable future, it will be free. I have to prove myself that I can meet the deadline every month with quality content. I&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Here is a super interesting article from David Shayer on Tidbits about <a href="https://tidbits.com/2020/10/08/four-reasons-why-we-wont-see-third-party-apple-watch-faces-and-what-apple-is-doing-instead/">why there may never be third-party Apple Watch Faces</a>. According to this software engineer who worked on the first two releases of watchOS, there may be four reasons why Apple probably won‚Äôt make a watch face store: battery life, buggy code, Apple‚Äôs image, copyright worries. Besides many interesting insights on watchOS development and testing, the reason that caught my attention is about Apple desire to control their image.</p>

<p>What is the killer app of the Apple Watch? The watch face, duh! Apple is an image control freak and I don‚Äôt think they want a watch face store full of crappy and bad taste designs to show up on users‚Äô Apple Watch. They lost control of the App Store, they don‚Äôt want the same story to happen with the watch. And I agree with this position. But there could be some sort of compromise, though. As pointed out by Matt Birchler in <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/4-reasons-apple-may-not-allow-third-party-watch-faces/">his commentary post</a> to Tidbits article:</p>

<p>‚Äú_CarPlay is a great example of how Apple could do this right with watch faces: only allow a certain number of companies to make custom watch faces. have them sign additional agreements and have them go through tougher reviews. Maybe there are literally 10 companies who are able to make watch faces. Maybe Apple can reject a watch face simply because they don‚Äôt like how it looks._‚Äù</p>

<p>My guess is that Apple will look to add more watch faces through collaborative work, just like they did in watchOS 7 with the Artist watch face.</p>

Besides <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/10/10/on-the-upcoming.html">my comments yesterday</a> on the opportunity for Apple to present redesigned Macs, having a separate event is a no brainer to me. This is a major transition for Apple and they certainly wants to get the message loud and clear.</p>

<p>If rumors are sound, Apple still have some time ahead to polish the upcoming macOS Big Sur release. <em>As it is today, it is not ready for prime time</em>. It may be the equivalent of the iOS 13 buggy release of this year. Even if Apple announces Macs in November, they could be ready to ship only in December, who knows, giving Apple even more time. Anyhow, I‚Äôm not is a rush to upgrade to Big Sur. Apps will have to follow the new look and feel and I‚Äôll wait for them to be updated first. The list is long.</p>

         	<p>While many pundits still wonder which Mac Apple will start transitioning the platform to their shiny and speedy silicon, my attention is on something else. I‚Äôm wondering if Apple will take this opportunity to introduce redesigned machines. Let‚Äôs say they start with the MacBook Pro, could they use this occasion to reimagine the laptop? What about the iMac which is way overdue for a redesign?</p>

<p>There are two avenues for Apple. One in which they opt for continuity. The other is to make a bold statement and turn the page on the Intel-based era. If prefer the latter as I‚Äôd like to see what it looks like after the era of Jony Ive. It‚Äôs a golden opportinity IMHO. Besides my preference, <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/09/23/the-rotten-side-of-tim-cooks-apple/">Tim Cook‚Äôs Apple is conservative</a> and they will probably opt for the former approach.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

Deliveries 9 helped me track my Apple Watch Series 6 (<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/10/03/upgrading-from-an-apple-watch-series-4-to-series-6/">read me review here</a>).</p>

<p>As you know, Junecloud, the maker of Deliveries, switched to a subscription model with this release. I don‚Äôt really like this model but what can I do? Their pricing is fair and they give to previously paid users a six months break.</p>

<p><a href="https://junecloud.com/press/deliveries/release-notes.html">Version 9</a> brings refined visuals and more details tracking history among other things. The importation workflow has been updated and simplified too. Once delivered, package tracking can be archived forever. iOS 13‚Äôs dark mode is now supported but iOS 14 widgets aren‚Äôt yet. I think Deliveries is the perfect candidate to support widgets and I can‚Äôt wait to see what Junecloud will come up with in that regard.</p>

<p>All in all, as a long time user of Deliveries, I‚Äôm ok with this update albeit the switch to the subcription model. If it get‚Äôs more frequent feature additions, I‚Äôm ok with it, I guess.</p>

         	<p>We should never read too much in <a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1313519797879988225?s=21">Apple&rsquo;s invite graphics</a>. They rarely have anything to do with the content of the event itself except maybe with the iPad with Retina Display invite a few years ago. Remember the finger on the screen?</p>

<p>Besides the obvious, an iPhone 12 line up announcement, what&rsquo;s in store? AirTags? Updated Apple TV with Apple&rsquo;s own game controller? HomePod mini? Don&rsquo;t expect Apple Silicon Macs until November. I don&rsquo;t expect Apple to talk about these next week. Apple Silicon Macs need  their own stage time in their own event.</p>

<p>Funny is the fact that iOS 14.1 is held back by Apple to fit this event. Probably contains a lot of hints of what is coming down the line.</p>

<p>The year 2020 can be an exciting one after all. I guess.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;m thinking way too much about widgets these days, thanks to iOS 14 most prominent new feature. I&rsquo;m still reflecting on the possible reasons why the full widgets experience is not available on iPadOS 14. That being said, <a href="https://micro.blog/mattbirchler">@mattbirchler</a> this week came out with an <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/concept-proper-widget-support-on-the-ipad/">interesting and informative video</a> showing how Apple could possibly enable the full widgets experience. This morning, still thinking about this concept, I realized something: <strong>Apple doesn&rsquo;t need to keep the today view support on the iPad in order to enable the full widgets experience</strong>.</p>

<p>I would argue that, in fact, Apple should get rid of the today view that came from the iPhone. One of the reason for this is how bad scrolling the today view works when you have a few widgets stacks; if you don&rsquo;t pay attention on where you put your finger to scroll this view, you actually end up scrolling through the stack itself instead of scrolling the whole view. That&rsquo;s not a good experience. The other reason is the iPad screen canvas makes it easy to rebuild the side view just by using the right widgets. No need to have scrolling.</p>

<p>I think Apple will eventually come up with an iPad-specific version of the widgets experience but not with the iPadOS 14 releases streak. And that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>

The context of this review was the fact that this new router was replacing my aging Apple AirPort. One of the reasons why I chose this device was because of its external look and finish as well as its superb management app.</p>

<p>One of the founder of Ubiquiti is an ex-Apple employee according to this 9to5Mac <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/06/27/ubiquiti/">article</a>: ‚Äú_an ex-Apple employee went on to found a company that currently sells enterprise networking gear.

There is a lot of untapped potential and frustrating design choices. <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/widgetsmith/id1523682319">Widgetsmith</a></strong> is having a moment right now but looks like a work-in-progress to me. It is a great idea but it can be tricky to configure and is not fully intuitive. There is so many more data sources the developer could add. And tell me how I would pay to get weather data in Widgetsmith while I can get it all for free with other apps. The added value of Widgetsmith lies in its configurability, not the fact that you can add weather as a source.</p>

         	<p>When iPadOS 14 beta came out, we were all quick to notice how crippled the widgets experience was compared to iOS 14. So we got frustrated. I‚Äôm still unable to get over it. Apple is holding back the iPad. Again.</p>

<p>In the last few days, I tried to understand the possible reasons behind this. To my surprise, it‚Äôs not easy and there could be many explanations to why the iPad widgets experience is limited to the Today view. More to come in a blog post this week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you are more than welcome to share your thoughts! I‚Äôm curious.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Carefully designed and thought out widgets are still scarce. Many developers show a lack of understanding of a widget‚Äôs purposes. Every single day, I&#8217;m baffled by the lack of flexibility on iPadOS. It&#8217;s a crime or a lack of courage, you tell me ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. </p>

<p>From an end-user perspective, managing widgets can be a frustrating experience. Apple can do better here. For example: in the screenshot below, users should be able to add a widget on an existing stack. Doing so on the home screen can mess your carefully designed arrangement pretty badly which will take careful manipulations to fix. Also, It&#8217;s hard to remember when there is a widgets stack instead of a single widget just looking at the home screen. On the iPad, scroll down the widgets will often trigger scrolling within the widgets stack instead which is frustrating. </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t miss the interactive version of widgets of pre-iOS 14. I have way too many home screen pages. What is the maximum, by the way? ü§î I tend to forget about the old iOS Today View. It&#8217;s the best place to Four-by-four widgets like news. In general, this is a great version 2.0 of widgets implementation. Looking forward for improved behaviors. </p>

<p>I have found and adopted a few great widgets: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widgetsmith/id1523682319">Widgetsmith</a> as a lot of potential, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumy/id908905093">Lumy</a> is really nice, Numerico (still in beta testing phase) is really useful Google analytics app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pedometer/id712286167">Pedometer</a> is a nice one too, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waterminder/id653031147">WaterMinder</a> a must for me, <a href="http://weatherlineapp.com/">Weather Line</a> the best design in this category, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buddywatch-watch-faces/id1526992897">Buddywatch</a> a wonderful and useful app for watch face lovers like me, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692">Streaks</a>.</p>

A third-party application named ‚Äú<a href="https://buddywatch.app">Buddywatch</a>‚Äù is super cool, yet doesn&rsquo;t fix the problem.</p>

<p>Now,  thanks to widgets support in iOS 14, I&rsquo;m even less satisfied with my iPhone home screen arrangement. I think it&rsquo;s worse than on my Apple Watch. Widgets, when I find one that is <a href="https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2020/09/16/on-developers-questionable.html">perfectly designed and really useful</a>, lack some flexibility. I never had so much different pages on my home screen. What the hell is happening? Technology should remove the burden on us, not the opposite.</p>

         	<p>Re-discovering Castro podcast player üéß. Much better than Apple‚Äôs Podcast app üëçüèª. Better design than Overcast üëåüèª. Super nice Watch app üòç. Impressive Shortcuts support. üë®üèª‚Äçüíª No iPad version, though üòï. Looking forward for iOS 14 widgets support and maybe a universal version with support for all platforms (is this even in the cards? üßê). Proudly supporting the developer by being a yearly subscriber now.</p>

         	<p>Following the #<strong>AppleEvent</strong> announcement yesterday, I saw many comments about a possible schedule of events this fall. Many of them are putting the release of the Apple Silicon Mac in October.</p>

<p>There is no way this is going to happen that early. macOS Big Sur is still at Beta 3. Developers are hard at work adding support for widgets and other iOS 14 stuff. I would expect iOS 14 to be released at the end of September. iOS 14.1 will come out in beta at the beginning of October in order to support the new iPhone shipping later in October.</p>

<p>Now back to the Mac. I expect Big Sur to be released at the very end of October if not November. The actual Apple Silicon Mac will probably be announced at a different moment than the iPhone. Apple doesn&rsquo;t like to mixed up things in their keynote. The actual shipping date could be at the very end of the year, just in time to catch the ramp up of the A14X production rumored to be starting in Q4.</p>

<p>In summary: Apple Silicon Mac to be released late in 2020.</p>

Tuesday 15 September: Event. Friday 18 September: Preorders start. Monday-Tuesday 21-22. September: Reviews drop‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâApple Watch on one day, iPad Air on the other. Thursday 24 September: New OSes released via Software Update. Friday 25 September: Products ship to customers and stores.</p>

<p>My guess is that we will get beta 8 this week followed by GM next week. Even if there is another beta after that (beta 9), this would be the shortest beta cycle for any major iOS release.

<p>Ouch. In other words: Adobe says: fuck you. That&rsquo;s the price of cloud-based storage services (on top of the monthly payment). No service is immute to this. We should be pressuring companies like Adobe, Apple, etc. to stop this non-sense.

One of the best feature is the ability to stack them. This allow for theme-based stacks on a theme-based home screen page. Can‚Äôt wait for more of my apps to be updated.</p>

         	<p>Great reviews on the latest iMac update. As a serious amateur photographer, the thing that stands out to me is the new nano glass option. At 500$ it is not cheap but reviewers are liking it a lot. Could this option eventually come to the iPad Pro? Or the iPhone? I would pay a premium for this on the iPad Pro.</p>

<p>Now, why the 21.5‚Äù iMac has not been updated is a mystery to me. I currently own a max-out 2017 21.5‚Äù iMac. The size of this machine is better for me, but I would prefer a 24‚Äù. Could this mean the lower size iMac will be the first desktop to receive the Apple Silicon treatment as well a the long overdue redesign? I think so.</p>

         	<p>Dear iOS developers: be careful when considering widget design and content. Space on my iPhone screen is more constrained than ever with iOS 14.

         	<p>Very valid complaint from Dieter Bohn of The Verge on Apple‚Äôs implementation of widgets management on iPhone. Two different user interfaces for basically the same objective. I prefer the look of the new design, but I understand the previous one is still there for compability purposes.</p>

<p>iOS 14 Beta 3 brings back the ¬´¬†Edit¬†¬ª button at the (very inconvenient place) bottom of the list. Hitting the button brings you back unexpectedly to the top of the widgets list. Going back down the list and you‚Äôll find a ‚ÄúCustomize‚Äù button. Really? Also, tapping and holding on old widgets doesn‚Äôt invoke edit mode. Not very consistent. I should probably fill a feedback report and send it to Apple.</p>

<p>I do think this is a transitional design. Transitions are rarely pleasant.</p>

         	<p>On Apple&rsquo;s 30% cut. Again.</p>

<p>We all know where this all goes. Yesterday it was a deal. Today, 30% is way too much. So, let‚Äôs fight and try to force Apple to set the cut to 20%. No, 15%. That is way better, right? A few years down the road, a well known developer comes out and complain about 15% being way too much of a cut. Poor guy. Let&rsquo;s start a fight and bring that down. Apple respond and set it to 10% because they are forced to. And the story continues.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face the reality. We don&rsquo;t like to pay for something. We want it all. We know the price of everything but the value of nothing. How do you think China came to be so powerful? How do you think Amazon or Costco is sucking air from small local businesses in our communities? Why do you think our life is full of shitty ads are everywhere? Why do you think we are the product of Google, Facebook? Because we don&rsquo;t like to pay for something, anything. We want it all free.</p>

<p>There is a pattern. There is a race for the bottom of everything. And I don&rsquo;t agree in Brent‚Äôs views on what would happen if Apple lowers their demand from developers. I certainly don&rsquo;t believe developers would lower the price of their apps.</p>

<p>Remember what capitalism is all about?</p>

<p>Change my mind.</p>

         	<p>iPadOS 15 concept imagined by <strong>Parker Ortolani</strong> certainly looks interesting. I&rsquo;m not sure about some ideas put forward but it certainly shows how the iPad is still held back with iPadOS 14. The lack of flexibility in widgets placement is, put mildly, baffling. I love those widgets on my iPhone but the lack of space forces us to create tons of pages. And the problem will only get worst this fall after developers start adding widget support in their apps. It will be crazy. #iPadOS14 #apple</p>

         	<p>One of the unexpected side effect of Apple introducing widgets in iOS 14 is that I&rsquo;m reconsidering my stance against big iPhone like iPhone 11 Pro Max.. when widgets invade our landscape this fall, we may find the iPhone 11 screen too small for all of them.</p>

<p>If Apple was willing to add the same flexibility to the iPad it would be another matter, though.</p>

         	<p>I‚Äôm one of those who was thinking discreet GPU would provide much better performance. When watching Apple‚Äôs transition to Apple Silicon, I asked myself about discreet GPU options in future Macs. This article goes on to report that not only integrated GPU (thanks to SoC) will be faster, it could be easier to support and help Apple reduce costs. Apple never offered discreet GPU in iPad Pro. Why would it be different with Apple Silicon-based Mac? Will future Mac support external GPU? Probably but performance gain will be marginal.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Excellent <strong>visual comparison between macOS Catalina and Big Sur</strong> (see link below). Here are a few observations:
* Big Sur design is a step back in clrity in many areas. Ex.: Icons and segmented controls in top portion of windows.
* More padding around items lists. I&rsquo;m not sure why. I prefer Catalina&rsquo;s version.
* Dark Mode is slightly better looking in Big Sur.
* Battery panel in Settings is horrible.
* Gone are popup alerts at the top of windows, they now look to be centered within window content and movable. Catalina is better.
* Menu bar is translucide. Catalina is better too.
* Safari is much better looking in Big Sur.
* Notes is much improved in Big Sur.
* Big Sur icons shapre are much more uniform. Advantage to Big Sur here.
* Big Sur Side Bars in many apps like Maps is better looking too.</p>

<p>Who wins? Well, the jury is still out.</p>

         	<p>Which Mac will transition first to Apple Silicon? Will Apple start with the desktop or the portables? That is the question. I would say, the desktop, but&hellip;</p>

<p>On the first Mac to be converted to ARM: <strong>my bet goes on the Mac mini</strong>, a lower volume, utility orientated machine for the Mac enthusiasts. Next, the iMac redesign where any perf discrepancies with the MacBook is more easily explanable (desktop versus laptop, you know). But&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;my confidence level in this theory will be negatively impacted by the actual release of a rumoured redesigned iMac but with an Intel processor instead. Rumors are circulating about a published benchmark with a 10 cores Intel CPU in a new iMac design. If Apple did release this machine, it would send a clear message: they will continue to support Intel machines for a long time. But&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;launching an iMac redesign with an Apple Silicon inside would make a much  better marketing story: something like a powerful Apple Silicon powering a brand new design with unique features (fan-less design, FaceID, or even&hellip; touch input support?). But&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;I concede the fact that price/watt ratio is much more useful and lends much more practical advantages on a portable product than on the desktop where space and energy are less constrained which puts some doubts on my take.</p>

<p>Finally, about the Mac Pro conversion to ARM. My gut feeling is that it will be the last to be converted&hellip; with A16 CPU? Who knows.</p>

<p>PS: I would expect Apple to re-introduce their illuminated logo on the MacBook. A sign of Apple‚Äôs enthusiast returning to the Mac.</p>

         	<p>Today, it will be interesting to see how Apple is positioning its move from Intel to ARM.</p>

<p>To me, one thing is clear: this could be another game changer move. Apple has proven many times in the past that you don&rsquo;t need to own a market (PC sales) to create new inflection points on its trajectory. Remember when Apple legitimize the use of the USB ports in its original iMac? Now, they could legitimize the use of ARM on traditional computers.</p>

         	<p>From <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/06/20/one_advantage_of_the_app_store_thats_gon">Brent Simmons</a>:</p>

<p><em>The best part of the App Store, years ago, from this developer‚Äôs point of view, was that it was easy to charge money for an app. No need to set up a system ‚Äî just choose the price, and Apple takes care of everything. So easy!</em></p>

<p>And</p>

<p><em>for many developers, the very best thing about the App Store ‚Äî the thing that actually helped their business ‚Äî is gone.</em></p>

<p>And this</p>

<p><em>I can‚Äôt reconcile in my mind the tension between Apple as the think different company, the pirates, the rebels, the company at the intersection of tech and liberal arts ‚Äî and Apple the company that runs this legalistic, nitpicky, greedy, inhuman, happy-face Kafka App Store.</em></p>

<p>And finally this</p>

<p><em>If I could distribute my iOS app outside of the App Store, I would. I‚Äôd switch in a heartbeat. Even though it‚Äôs free and money isn‚Äôt my issue. It would make my work as an app maker easier.</em></p>

<p>Ouch. Coming this guy, it means a lot.</p>

<p>WWDC20 already has a special feel to it, even before the start&hellip; not only because it is digital only, but also because I feel (many) developers are simpky fed up with the Apple way.</p>

         	<p>It is fun to compare <strong>HEY</strong> and <strong>Micro.blog</strong>. They both depend on open web standards on the <strong>backend</strong>. HEY depends on SMTP while Micro.blog depends on HTTPS/HTML. HEY wants to re-invent the end-user experience while Micro.blog provides a pretty much generic end-user experience. By turning the end-user experience upside down, HEY doesn&rsquo;t rely on IMAP. This is where some people turns their back to HEY (there may be other reasons, though).</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Interesting piece (see link below) about software quality going down in a world where hardware quality is culminating to levels never seen before. Here are a few of my thoughts on this subject.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, I think the law of entropy is much more active in software than in hardware. We are actually witnessing the slow disorganization of software (both in features &amp; code), hence the quality goes down with it.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, we are also witnessing the (good and bad) consequences of unsustainable complexity of a growing software ecosystem. The good is the added value of combining things together in order to make the whole greater than the sum of its part. Apple is good at this. The bad is the difficulty to make it all work.</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, take the Finder in macOS. How many revisions has been done on this essential piece of software and by how many generations and teams of developers? How one company make sure, from one generation to the other, the knowledge about how the Finder is coded doesn&rsquo;t get diluted? I see this as an important challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Finally</strong>, the marriage of hardware with software, the complete integration of the stack that Apple is able to achieve because they nearly own all the pieces pose big challenges.   There are so many combinaisons to test and optimize. I can see many bugs falling between the cracks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not excusing Apple for the fact that their software quality is going down. They must slowdown and consolidate their software assets. In a maturing world, I would expect they do just that.</p>

         	<p>In <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/2020/05/31/my-wish-list-for-wwdc-2020/">my recently published wish list for WWDC 2020</a>, I think I under-stated how anxious I am about the &ldquo;virtual keynote&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I wish for something closer to a movie than a keynote. Not too much on the info-pub side, something entertaining while being informative and enticing. I want to see Tim Cook at the main character, Craig Federighi in a supporting role. Don&rsquo;t be too ‚Äúgeneral public‚Äù, be geeky as hell. Impress me, delight me. Show me the future, now!</p>

<p>My expectations are (too?) high for WWDC 2020. I know.</p>

         	<p>Death is an everyday subject these days. How is Apple helping people in dealing with people's death? For example, what happens to Apple's Family Sharing if the family organizer passed away? If you use iTunes Family Sharing, special attention must be paid to the ¬´ Family Organizer ¬ª role. If he or she dies, there is no way to give this role to another member of the iTunes Family. Have you ever wondered what happens if you want to close an Apple ID account of a diseased person? What if you don't even know how to access it?</p>

<p>Searching for the word ¬´ death ¬ª on Apple‚Äôs support site doesn‚Äôt bring any information related to tackling the death of someone. Apple's support to help users deal with death is abysmal.</p>

<p>Well said. For me, it doesn‚Äôt represent an issue. I love to buy into this philosophy because it is different, delightful. His tweet, one is a series is interesting. But, one the following ones, things get just wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Propping iPad up at a *good* angle? Pay $350 for a cover that prevents you from using it like a book anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt get it. Remove the iPad from its keyboard and voil√†! Simple. And this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the iPad is now a worse tablet with the Magic Keyboard. It kind of sucks for typing in bed compared to the software keyboard, and it‚Äôs unusable for reading since it doesn‚Äôt flip around like a true cover.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? Can someone explain him that he can remove the iPad from the keyboard when he goes to bed at night? This thread just feel ‚Äútrolly". The iPad is obviously not for him but he doesn‚Äôt know it yet.¬†</p>

         	<p>Here is something that bugs me with ‚Äú<strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>‚Äù or with services that are supporting this feature.</p>

<p>The easy and fun part is when you sign up as a new user of a service supporting ‚Äú<strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>‚Äù. But what if I‚Äôm an already signed up user for many years then I want to switch to ‚Äú<strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>‚Äù without creating a new account? Some service are providing a way to link an Apple ID in order to enable ‚Äú<strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>‚Äù. But it is the minority. WordPress.com is such an example.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>

Just listen to press conferences, one after the other. It is disgusting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if in recent days I&rsquo;m calling out more things about politics, The Clown in Chief and the US. I should be writing about Apple, photography my dear passions.

         	<p>As a weather enthusiast, <strong>Apple buying Dark Sky</strong> is a very good news for at least two reasons. First, the Dark Sky app is not available in Canada. Apple will probably extend the service coverage in future releases. Second, it may signal Apple&rsquo;s intentions to beef up its weather stock apps on all its platforms.</p>

         	<p>I have a dear friend living in Denver, Co. He has a PhD in human comm. He is brilliant. But, he doesn&rsquo;t understand all the fuss about <strong>COVID-19</strong>. For him, shutting down everything is over reacting. I tried to explain the curve, the pressure on health care system, etc. He thinks the flu is worst and yet we don&rsquo;t shut down the country. I said yes and no.</p>

<p><strong>We shouldn&rsquo;t trust current numbers in the US because they are way undervaluated.</strong> There is no reason to think the US population will be affected differently than other population in other countries without containment. They will. And it will be much worst becaue there is a lack of major containment as of this writing. The US is a the beginning of the curve. The exponential curve. This will be ugly. Remember: a single day of &ldquo;wait-and-see&rdquo; does make a big dfference and we have the numbers and the experience of other countries to prove it.</p>

Very simple gesture: single tap as it should be. My guess is that developers wouldn&rsquo;t need to update their app in order to support this new model. It does fix the problem of finding the second app to bring in. Second, how the hell do they make these animations? How do we bring this to Apple&rsquo;s attention?

         	<p>Interesting newcomer in the note taking apps landscape: <strong>Noto - Elegant Note</strong>. Really nice design. Not sure about long term viability (remember Evernote?). Not sure about design scalability with a lot of notes. Another subscription to take care of. Not cheap for a young app. MacStories.net has more to say about it for sure. I&rsquo;ll keep on eye on that one.

         	<p>When so many apps are available for a specific task, choosing one can be a nightmare. Recently, my focus was to select a new calendar app following the release of Fantastical update. I finally settled on the one that I use for a few years now: Calendar 5. The same is happening right now with RSS readers. But this time, I‚Äô‚Äôm switching from the excellent Reeder app to News Explorer. The latter is not perfect but from a functional point of view, it is an improvement. More on this soon.</p>

Follow this <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-a-copy-of-your-apple-account-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide</a>. Google offers the same. Now it is easier than ever to know what they know about us. Now, the next step will be to help people designate others that should be allowed to get access the data once we pass away.</p>

         	<p>&lt;&lt;<p>There is quite a lot of buzz these days about the possibility of creating our own watch face on the Apple Watch. Currently, this feature is not available to Apple Watch owners but a few clever guys on the internet did experiment with tools to create ones. And the possibilities are endless. And quite exciting too.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is something sterile and compromising about choosing your watch face out of a fixed set of options. While the watchOS faces provide for a high degree of customization, there is something fundamentally different in being able to customize <strong>every</strong> single detail of the face. I started with a blank slate and was able to make the face look exactly how I wanted it. When displaying one of my creations it is now truly <em>my</em> most personal device ever.</p></blockquote>

         	<p>Tonight I was watching TV. There was so many ads. One particular ad got my attention. This was an ad about a car. In order to show how cool the car is, how useful it can be to its users, there a scene where the driver uses Siri to send a message to his wife saying he is way home. A flawless experience. We can see Siri animated waves and the audio feedback, something known to a lot of people. But there is something wrong with all this.</p>

<p>Siri seems the underdog of all virtual assistants. People can‚Äôt stop complaining about it and how far behind it is. Yet, advertisers chose Siri over Google Assistant for this ad. If Google is so much better, why advertisers can‚Äôt choose Google to convey flawless virtual assistant experience? Is Apple</p>
