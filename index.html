<p>What a strange, busy, surprising place. Strangely, I didn’t take as many pictures as I could. I guess I was too busy looking around me, up, down, everywhere. 🤯</p>
<p>Visiting this Medina was like reliving the past, like going back in 800. Our guide told us that not that many things has changed since the early years. But man, everything is so coupled with the Islamic religion. I’m not used to that.</p>
<p>The Medina is a city in a city. You’ll find everything from food, clothes, and fake Apple gear (a lot). Oh, and, the young generation of sellers are all tied to their smartphone, all the time. I’m not sure this helps do good business. 🤔</p>
<p>Oh and boy we eat too much in Morocco.</p>

Strangely enough, I rarely use Day One other than for peeking at past memories of my publications (automatically added through IFTTT automation with RSS feeds). I rarely add to my personal journal.

			 <p>Just finished configuring my <strong>WhatsApp</strong> account on my iPhone. What a weird user experience. I couldn&rsquo;t get my verification code to be sent by SMS after many tries. Finally asked to be called. WhatsApp asked me if I wanted to restore data from a non-existent iCloud backup. My account is configured with my current phone number which I&rsquo;m pretty sure won&rsquo;t work once I&rsquo;m in Morocco. I bet that changing this phone number will require me to access my SMS on my primary line, which won&rsquo;t be possible because I&rsquo;ll depend on an eSIM. I&rsquo;m not sure what is my &ldquo;WhatsApp handle&rdquo; either if such a thing exists. What is I prefer to use my email address so people can find me? I should probably spend an hour googling to sort this out.</p>
<p>And WhatsApp is the de-facto standard in most parts of the world, except North America.</p>

			 <p>Warning: it&rsquo;s not about the <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong> headset, which many people think will bring a touch of a dystopian future to our life. Something else more serious will.</p>
<p>I read this week somewhere that, to get <strong>climate</strong> back into the normality zone🌪️ to ensure the sustainability of the human race and life in general, everyone on earth would need to live in an oppressive world where everything would be controlled by laws and government all the time and for decades. From buying food to cars to travelling to entertainment services, we would be under constant quotas, which would bring our quality of life much lower than we currently enjoy. In fact, developed countries' quality of life would join the much lower quality of life of the vast majority of the earth&rsquo;s population in less developed countries. This would be the only way to get around this climate crisis. Not convinced? The COVID pandemic brought massive and repetitive confinements that weren&rsquo;t enough to bend many climate change indicators downwards. It lasted two years, more or less. 😱</p>
<p>Oh, and should we talk about forced birth control everywhere? Because we should, even if this is a taboo subject.</p>
<p>Are we ready for this dystopian world? 😷</p>
<p>I can see a great Vision Pro use case right here where people watch daylong movies about what used to be a much more enjoyable world in 3D. 😒</p>

<p>Nobody talks about the device&rsquo;s size when you use it on your lap like I do with my MBA right now as I write this post. It&rsquo;s an important factor to consider for such laptop category which the MBA is targeting. Are 15 inches too wide? Is it still comfortable? For some reason, I have a few doubts. This 15-inch MacBook Air is&hellip; big, but is it too big for me? 🤔</p>

While waiting for everyone to join the meeting, wanting to fill in the silence, I asked where he was from. He responded, &ldquo;Russia.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; 😱 This was followed by a big silence while I could see in mack back my Tidbyt display showing a prominent Ukrainian flag. 🇺🇦👊🏻We moved on to the meeting&rsquo;s first subject. 😏😂</p>
<p>A colleague of mine told me after the meeting that not all Russians are ok with this war in Ukraine. Yeah, right. I guess. This is not a valuable excuse in my book. Where are the diaspora demonstrations, in Canada? In the US?</p>

			 <p>My nephew, a semi-pro photographer, recently sold 90% of his photography gear (<strong>Canon</strong>). He only kept one body and one 50mm lens. 😱 He upgraded his phone to the iPhone 14 Pro. 😏He couldn&rsquo;t be happier, he told me. Even with the iPhone, he essentially kept his photo-processing workflow as-is (Adobe Lightroom). This makes me pause a bit. Sure, he spends much less time doing professional photography work, but still. I call this the iPhone-photography killer effect.</p>
<p>He got his first exposure (pun intended) to the art of photography with me when he was still a child, more than thirty years ago, when he accompanied me for a short photowalk. He demonstrated that he could be a photographer, even at this young age, just by his numerous questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring my small (but heavy) camera gear (<strong>Nikon</strong>) on my trip to Morocco and when I visit the Canary Islands later this summer. Will these trips be the last ones where I use the big one? 🤔 I know that I&rsquo;m going to upgrade my iPhone 13 Pro to the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro Max later this fall. This could trigger a similar fate to my camera bag.</p>

I don’t know how I could not think of this before. I’ve been a big fan of Day One forever. It’s such a rich journaling app for the Mac, the iPad and the iPhone.

			 <p>Still working from the coffee shop. 😅 While reading a technical document, I wish I could take notes and keep bookmarks about my readings. I discovered that, as well-thoughtful my personal creative workflow can be, I’m under-equipped for my work life🤦🏻‍♂️. <strong>OneNotes</strong> from Microsoft is great but so dull at the same time. This leaves me with <strong>Notion</strong> and <strong>Craft Docs</strong>. 🙄🤔 I really have to up my game at work; I’m way too lousy. I should use lessons learned from my blogger life.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still slowly digesting Apple news of this week (think of a cow 🐄 in the field 🌿). About <strong>macOS Sonoma widgets</strong> 🖼️: it&rsquo;s surprising that Apple is showing widgets to be perfectly aligned when they are dropped on the desktop background. According to some YouTuber&rsquo;s early reviews, you can be messy with them and drop them wherever you want. People will get messy, for sure.</p>

<p>It’s Apple keynote day, and it is exciting but also stressful! Here are last-minute questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will the headset pricing be announced today?</li>
<li>Will the headset be like the Apple Watch and be running apps, or will it be more like CarPlay, with some additional viewport from the iPhone? Or a combination?</li>
<li>Is the headset unveiled with a “one more thing” segment?</li>
<li>When the iPad was announced, Steve Jobs spent some time explaining its relative position within the use cases spectrum of our computing devices. Where does the headset fit?</li>
<li>Will the headset announcement overshadow Apple’s timid foray into generative AI?</li>
<li>Is Xcode finally coming to the iPad?</li>
<li>Can we infer something about the rumors setting the price 1999$ when we compare that to the AirPods Max price?</li>
<li>Tim Cook’s air time has decreased in recent events, is the trend continuing today?</li>
<li>Can we expect another meme moment from <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/leadership/craig-federighi/">Craig Federighi</a>?</li>
<li>Who’s going to present the headset? <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/leadership/jeff-williams/">Jeff Williams</a>, just like for the Apple Watch Ultra?</li>
<li>Can any of the announcements today affect my Apple hardware upgrade plan?</li>
</ul>
<p>For someone who’s not interested in the headset, I have far too many questions about it. I’ll return to this post once the event is complete to fill in the answers!</p>

			 <p>👉🏻 This is <strong>WWDC day</strong>! Here are some informative tidbits. Two weeks ago, I set up a fake meeting in my work calendar for the entire afternoon (EST time here). I’ll be out of the office for the whole afternoon. I’ve been doing that for more than ten years. It worked 9 out of 10 times. I should be good to go today.</p>
<p>I’ll watch the keynote from within Safari to take screenshots (with the TV app, screenshots don’t work 🤔). Then, using a configured button on my <strong>StreamDeck</strong> mini, I’ll take the screenshots that will be saved and moved to my <strong>Synology</strong> NAS automatically; thanks to <strong>Hazel</strong>. The excellent Mastodon client, <strong>Ivory</strong>, will be running too side-by-side so that I can see reactions coming in. Sadly, feed streaming is not yet a thing on Mastodon, apparently.</p>
<p>My expectations are relatively low for all the tech announcements but high for the keynote production value and quality.</p>

			 <p>Here’s a short “life at the office” story. Our VP of sales never stops bragging about how <strong>ChatGPT</strong> is cool and how it works for him for many use cases. I’m uncomfortable with his stance on ChatGPT &amp; generative AI in general. I think about it each time he sends an email that was obviously created with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Why is it a problem for me? Who am I to judge him and his “new way of working”? I think I have found the root cause.</p>
<p>First, it’s not the results of his work. It’s the work of something else. He takes something “as is” without adding any value, any personal opinion, or a personal twist. Second, the fundamental problem is that he works in IT but is not a tech guy. He is a salesperson. He’s the type of guy who surfs on buzzwords a lot. Using ChatGPT makes him circumvent his lack of confidence because of a lack of IT knowledge and culture. He probably feels better and more “into the game” like most of my other colleagues, who studied computer science before getting to work in IT.</p>
<p>How many more people lack my colleague do the same, for the same reason?</p>

			 <p>For my next trip, I will bring my <strong>Nikon D750</strong> and my <strong>iPhone 13 Pro</strong> (of course!), and my 2018 11-inch <strong>iPad Pro</strong>. How am I going to process my images? Will I continue using <strong>Lightroom</strong> for images from my Nikon? I usually use the iPad to import my photos into the Lightroom catalogue. What about pictures on my iPhone, which should be mostly in RAW format and shot with <strong>Halide</strong>? I like <strong>Photomator</strong> a lot; it is nicer than Lr and more approachable too. However, using Photomator to process images from my Nikon poses a challenge in file management. I’ll need to import the .NEF files from my SD card into my iPad in an <strong>iCloud Drive</strong> folder so I can work on imported files from any device (iPad, MacBook Air or iPhone). I prefer using iCloud Photos Library instead of managing files manually. I guess this will be this combo: Photomator + Halide for my “shot on iPhone” images!</p>
<p>Just writing this blog post made things a little bit less fuzzy. I’ll take any suggestions!</p>

			 <p><img src="https://numericcitizen-test.micro.blog/uploads/2023/a24a99b754.png" alt="Thumbnails of my produced YouTube videos" title="Thumbnails of my produced YouTube videos"></p>
<p>A year ago, I shared my first YouTube video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos">my YouTube channel</a>. My initial goal was to share videos about using <strong>Craft</strong>, but later came videos about using <strong>Micro.blog</strong>. Here are some notable facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>52 videos about Craft were produced;</li>
<li>5 videos about Micro.blog were produced;</li>
<li>All videos totalling more than 13.5 hours of watch time;</li>
<li>My YouTube channel has 813 subscribers as of now;</li>
<li>Two subscribers gave me money as a sign of appreciation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel I’m now on par with all the things I wanted to talk about regarding Craft. Future Craft videos will touch on new features and tweaked workflow. I still have much work to do for Micro.blog video series, though.</p>
<p>At the initial pace of new subscribers, I set the goal of hitting a thousand subscribers in the first year, but I’m sad to report that I won’t make it. The pace of new subscribers has slowed quite a bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://numericcitizen-test.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f56e1ad564.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This video production journey is full of learning and lessons. Over time, I settled on a production style I’m happy with. I finally found a way to get better sound quality. I recently added iA Presenter to get cue cards showing on my screen while recording (read “<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/ia-presenter-a-different-clever-take-at-presentation-software/">iA Presenter — A Different &amp; Clever Take at Presentation Software</a>”). My workflow is stable now and is supported by <a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/youtube-video-production-template">this Craft template</a> (you can download and use it if you are a Craft user, BTW). Finally, I started using <strong>Play.app</strong> to gather all my video links in one place. This provides a quick way to refer to past videos whenever needed.</p>
<p>I also produced videos about other apps like <strong>Capacities</strong>, <strong>Inoreader</strong> and <strong>Anybox</strong>. Some of these videos take the form of a 60 minutes session with the app as a first-time user. It’s fun as there is no script supporting those experiences.</p>
<p>Today, I will record a video about the WWDC 23 conference. The video will complement my recently published <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/apples-wwdc-2023-keynote-thoughts-before-the-news-flood/">article</a> on the same subject. It will be my first foray into tech news and commentary. I’m not planning to do many of these, but WWDC is significant and needs some of my production time attention.</p>

			 <p>My morning so far. Just finished and shared <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/ia-presenter-a-different-clever-take-at-presentation-software/">my thoughts on iA Presenter</a>. Got myself ready to watch the WWDC 23 keynote using this <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/06/03/getting-ready-for.html">handy shortcut</a>. I tried to set up a mail address for <strong>numericcitizen.me</strong> (something like <a href="mailto:hello@numericcitizen.me">hello@numericcitizen.me</a>) using <strong>iCloud+ Mail custom domain</strong> feature. Sadly, I won’t be able to do so as my numericcitizen.me root domain needs to be aliasing Ghost hosting website for my blog to work. This is conflicting with iCloud+ Mail custom domain requirements. Oh well, nobody use emails these days, right, right? Any suggestion on this if you are reading this? Finally, updated my Ubiquity DreamMachine to the latest release of UniFi OS.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/06/01/on-reddit-api.html">On Reddit API Access Pricing</a></h1>

			 <p>So, apparently, just like Twitter, Reddit is entering into a &ldquo;kill-third-party-apps&rdquo; by charging an enormous amount of money to use their APIs. It looks like it. Apollo isn&rsquo;t happy, and for good reasons. Unless there was a calculation error from the makers of Apollo, it just makes no sense for them to continue. Maybe Reddit made some calculation errors, too. Perhaps they fail to read the room&rsquo;s temperature. But maybe they are entitled, to some degree, I guess, to charge for their APIs, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to make a parallel with Apple&rsquo;s dreaded 15%-30% App Store commission. Is Apple&rsquo;s stance on its App Store different from Reddit&rsquo;s stance on its APIs? Is charging a commission to be on the App Store and take advantage of all Apple&rsquo;s technology to get a chance to be distributed on hundreds of millions of iPhones similar to consuming a platform APIs? If not, what is different, actually? Is free API usage a dead end in today&rsquo;s world? There are whole business models built around APIs these days. API speaks intellectual property in my book. Only companies with business models supported by massive ad distribution or expansive paid subscriptions can think of thriving by giving away their API access. It will be interesting to see how Reddit is reacting to third-party developers' pushback.</p>
<p>Oh, and if they actually kill the third-party Reddit client ecosystem, unlike Twitter, Reddit platform alternatives are not obvious to me.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s time to remember: there is no such thing as a free lunch.</p>
