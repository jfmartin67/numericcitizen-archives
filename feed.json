My initial goal was to share videos about using <strong>Craft</strong>, but later came videos about using <strong>Micro.blog</strong>. Here are some notable facts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>52 videos about Craft were produced;</li>\n<li>5 videos about Micro.blog were produced;</li>\n<li>All videos totalling more than 13.5 hours of watch time;</li>\n<li>My YouTube channel has 813 subscribers as of now;</li>\n<li>Two subscribers gave me money as a sign of appreciation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I feel I‚Äôm now on par with all the things I wanted to talk about regarding Craft. Future Craft videos will touch on new features and tweaked workflow. I still have much work to do for Micro.blog video series, though.</p>\n<p>At the initial pace of new subscribers, I set the goal of hitting a thousand subscribers in the first year, but I‚Äôm sad to report that I won‚Äôt make it. The pace of new subscribers has slowed quite a bit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://numericcitizen-test.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f56e1ad564.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This video production journey is full of learning and lessons. Over time, I settled on a production style I‚Äôm happy with. I finally found a way to get better sound quality. I recently added iA Presenter to get cue cards showing on my screen while recording (read ‚Äú<a href=\"https://numericcitizen.me/ia-presenter-a-different-clever-take-at-presentation-software/\">iA Presenter ‚Äî A Different &amp; Clever Take at Presentation Software</a>‚Äù). My workflow is stable now and is supported by <a href=\"https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/youtube-video-production-template\">this Craft template</a> (you can download and use it if you are a Craft user, BTW). Finally, I started using <strong>Play.app</strong> to gather all my video links in one place. This provides a quick way to refer to past videos whenever needed.</p>\n<p>I also produced videos about other apps like <strong>Capacities</strong>, <strong>Inoreader</strong> and <strong>Anybox</strong>.

				"content_text": "![Thumbnails of my produced YouTube videos](https://numericcitizen-test.micro.blog/uploads/2023/a24a99b754.png \"Thumbnails of my produced YouTube videos\")\n\nA year ago, I shared my first YouTube video on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos). My initial goal was to share videos about using **Craft**, but later came videos about using **Micro.blog**. Here are some notable facts:\n\n- 52 videos about Craft were produced;\n- 5 videos about Micro.blog were produced;\n- All videos totalling more than 13.5 hours of watch time;\n- My YouTube channel has 813 subscribers as of now;\n- Two subscribers gave me money as a sign of appreciation.\n\nI feel I‚Äôm now on par with all the things I wanted to talk about regarding Craft. Future Craft videos will touch on new features and tweaked workflow. I still have much work to do for Micro.blog video series, though.\n\nAt the initial pace of new subscribers, I set the goal of hitting a thousand subscribers in the first year, but I‚Äôm sad to report that I won‚Äôt make it. The pace of new subscribers has slowed quite a bit.\n\n![](https://numericcitizen-test.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f56e1ad564.png)\n\nThis video production journey is full of learning and lessons. Over time, I settled on a production style I‚Äôm happy with. I finally found a way to get better sound quality. I recently added iA Presenter to get cue cards showing on my screen while recording (read ‚Äú[iA Presenter ‚Äî A Different & Clever Take at Presentation Software](https://numericcitizen.me/ia-presenter-a-different-clever-take-at-presentation-software/)‚Äù). My workflow is stable now and is supported by [this Craft template](https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/youtube-video-production-template) (you can download and use it if you are a Craft user, BTW). Finally, I started using **Play.app** to gather all my video links in one place. This provides a quick way to refer to past videos whenever needed.\n\nI also produced videos about other apps like **Capacities**, **Inoreader** and **Anybox**. Some of these videos take the form of a 60 minutes session with the app as a first-time user. It‚Äôs fun as there is no script supporting those experiences.\n\nToday, I will record a video about the WWDC 23 conference. The video will complement my recently published [article](https://numericcitizen.me/apples-wwdc-2023-keynote-thoughts-before-the-news-flood/) on the same subject. It will be my first foray into tech news and commentary. I‚Äôm not planning to do many of these, but WWDC is significant and needs some of my production time attention.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/bc144c43da.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After reading Gruber‚Äôs <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/wavelength\">article</a> about <strong>Wavelength</strong>, I decided to try it. I‚Äôm not sure I require another messaging solution. Besides using Apple‚Äôs iMessage and Telegram to get news from Ukraine, the rest of my messaging app usage is anecdotic.</p>\n<p>So, what are my thoughts about this? The initial few moments with Wavelength are not what I call an honest onboarding experience. Well, I already <a href=\"https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/03/28/for-those-who.html\">shared my surprise</a> at having to enter my phone number at the very first step of the application onboarding. I thought it was brutal. I was quickly reminded that asking for our phone number is the usual thing to ask in a messaging app. M‚Äôok. ü§® But hey, Wavelength is still in beta, right? So, let‚Äôs give them a break.</p>\n<p>So I created a group called <strong>Microbloggers</strong> (<a href=\"https://wavelength.app/invite/K8vZnQI51dy#M3iTwlw1LzkPjaBFp8UZGw--\">invite link</a>) for hosting people coming from Micro.blog (well, anyone with the link can join).

				"content_text": "![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/6803/2023/bc144c43da.png)\n\nAfter reading Gruber‚Äôs [article](https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/wavelength) about **Wavelength**, I decided to try it. I‚Äôm not sure I require another messaging solution. Besides using Apple‚Äôs iMessage and Telegram to get news from Ukraine, the rest of my messaging app usage is anecdotic. \n\nSo, what are my thoughts about this? The initial few moments with Wavelength are not what I call an honest onboarding experience. Well, I already [shared my surprise](https://blog.numericcitizen.me/2023/03/28/for-those-who.html) at having to enter my phone number at the very first step of the application onboarding. I thought it was brutal. I was quickly reminded that asking for our phone number is the usual thing to ask in a messaging app. M‚Äôok. ü§® But hey, Wavelength is still in beta, right? So, let‚Äôs give them a break.\n\nSo I created a group called **Microbloggers** ([invite link](https://wavelength.app/invite/K8vZnQI51dy#M3iTwlw1LzkPjaBFp8UZGw--)) for hosting people coming from Micro.blog (well, anyone with the link can join). As I‚Äôm writing this, there are 25 members. I‚Äôm surprised. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that many people to join. I guess my Micro.blog circle is made of very curious people. I love this. Is [@Manton](https://micro.blog/Manton) joining? Nope. But [@Jean](https://micro.blog/Jean) is among the participant, which I find cool! \n\nMy general feeling with the application is that its design reminds me of Micro.blog‚Äôs simplicity.

Why? The MacBook Pro is based on the M2. Even if people buy computers, not chips, it would send a weird signal to have an M3 product at the entry level while the Pro machines are using M2. The 3 nanometer process will probably help reduce heat dissipation, but the last time I checked, the M2 in the 13-inch MacBook Air doesn't exhibit any problems, even when the machine is running at full processing power. \r\n\r\nOne possibility, though, is if the M3 chip really helps make a difference from an end-user perspective enough to entice users to upgrade. We'll see soon enough. And I can't wait to get my hands on the 15-inch version of the MacBook Air.\n",

One was a Russian in a T-shirt who was carrying a box of ammunition more than 1,800 metres behind the front line ‚Äì a distance Teflon says was the longest shot he‚Äôs ever made. ‚ÄúHe saw no threat, he thought he was safe.

If you‚Äôre well-known, again, the higher the likelihood that you will make it to the timeline of others. \n\nI‚Äôm not well-known. I didn‚Äôt engage that much with others. Both made me a near-nobody on Twitter. So I didn‚Äôt get exposure, hence the lack of engagement with my content.\n\nThird, there is just too much noise on Twitter to get noticed. My content competes against the rest of the Twittosphere. My context was noise for others, hence the lack of feedback, comments, and interactions. \n\nHere on Micro.blog? Night and day. I‚Äôm not a star, far from it. But I get a sense that some people are paying attention. \n\nThanks for that anyway. ü§ó\n\n",

They preferred to go the Twitter route instead. That was before the Elon Musk fiasco. As you might expect, it was a deception for me, and I preferred Matter to build its own thing instead. I actually like to comment on articles and share my thoughts on them within the Matter sphere. Oh well‚Ä¶¬†</p>\n<p>How ironic things can sometimes be.

It was in my early days here on Micro.blog. Then came the teaser strategy era. Taking advantage of Micro.blog cross-posting feature, all my posts had to be cross-posted on Twitter and made sure to systematically add hashtags to the post's title to get attention. People on Twitter using hashtags for search could potentially hit my posts. That was total nonsense. Then, the \"titled strategy\" came in where all my posts would get a title. Readers would then need to expand my post to read the content. Lastly, the current strategy, the best IMO, is to use the title for longer posts only. Otherwise, I leave the title field empty, hoping readers will hit the link to read the rest of the post.</p>\n<p>Maybe I should have set the title for this one. ü§î</p>\n",

Let‚Äôs say you shoot a photo in RAW and then switch to Apple‚Äôs Photos app. Tapping on the thumbnail brings up the image, and after a few seconds, the image gets changed to a lower-quality version. Contrast is lost, and exposure is somewhat lowered. The result is a dull image. My possible explanation is that the thumbnail is a JPEG post-processed interpretation of the RAW image that is presented in the UI. When tapping on the thumbnail, the RAW version gets uncompressed and presented, which replaces the full-size JPEG preview version, hence the image quality degradation.¬†</p>\n<p>Do you have a similar understanding, or do you have another explanation?</p>\n",

More often than not, those publishing content on SoundCloud wants you to buy ¬†what's available on Beatport. Someone told me recently to use Beatport instead. I may switch from SoundCloud to Beatport for 2023. Second, I‚Äôll continue my slow migration from Smugmug to <a href=\"https://stories.numericcitizen.photos\">my Exposure page</a>. Smugmug was good but didn‚Äôt fit well with what I expected from a modern photo-sharing service. Third, I finally found a use case for recording videos with CleanShot. I‚Äôll use it to add short video clips showing how to use specific features and tricks in Craft. Those clips will be added to <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/vgvQKijqkbyo6q\">The Craft Bible</a>¬†(a website dedicated to Craft, the document writing app) and will come as a complement to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos\">my YouTube channel</a>.

I didn‚Äôt find any so far.¬†</li>\n<li>I still don‚Äôt understand how a Micro.blog compatible Mastodon name is helping in any of this.¬†</li>\n<li>Having a registered account on a Mastodon won‚Äôt do much for me.

Physically, the device feels high quality and well-designed and is framed with real wood, reminiscent of mid-century furniture.</p>\n<p>Content is configured using applets that you put together on a canvas. The display content will switch from one applet to another in the order defined on the canvas. Applets can be set to display only on a specific schedule, but the scheduling options are rather limited. It‚Äôs very simple to set this up.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Tuesday, 20 Dec 2022 06:37:07.png\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9d26fb048a.png\" alt=\"Tuesday 20 Dec 2022 06 37 07\" width=\"2000\" height=\"621\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Once the display is plugged into power via its USB-C cable, it will wait for the configuration to be done from the smartphone, a six-step process. Bluetooth is required to detect the display, and a Wifi network is required for the display to get its data from the Internet. <img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Tuesday, 20 Dec 2022 06:49:36.png\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/b1348d9ebe.png\" alt=\"Tuesday 20 Dec 2022 06 49 36\" width=\"1037\" height=\"2000\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The applets catalogue is growing but still is relatively limited. Thanks to an SDK and open APIs, developers constantly add new ones. The display is bright and can be adjusted according to a manual setting or time of the day. There is a night mode, too, if you want to put the device in one bedroom.</p>\n<p>The screen resolution seemed low at first, but from a distance, it is surprisingly good, enough to display small images.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Tidbyt makes a great addition to my home office, and people at work have already noticed it during Teams meetings and are asking questions about this little thing sitting on the shelf behind me.</p>\n",

One of the best features is the customizable Lock Screen. But it also creates an issue, the same with Apple Watch watch faces: how to decide which widgets to use and place in those limited slots. There are more and more widgets available each day, but the space is so constrained. I cannot find a strategy to create a Lock Screen that I‚Äôm fully satisfied with. I end up creating many of them, but switching among them isn‚Äôt smooth, except if they are linked to a focus mode. It‚Äôs not a first-world problem, but it is annoying.

This application is really at the center of everything I do online, as thoroughly documented in <a href=\"https://numericcitizen.io/2021/12/18/my-blogger-workflow-as-of-2021-12\">my blogger workflow</a>. That being said, I always keep an eye open for competing services, thanks to my Twitter list ‚Äú<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/1346445507560960003\">Apps &amp; Services</a>‚Äù. Notion is one of them. Before Craft, there was Notion, which I loved too. But it felt too complicated or overkill for my needs. Craft is nowhere near Notion in terms of features. There is no comparison, even though <a href=\"https://numericcitizen.me/2021/03/12/craft-vs-notion-from-a-bloggers-perspective/\">I wrote one</a>. Really. Yet, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NotionHQ\">their recent tweets</a>, Notion has been on a roll lately, adding features, tweaking things or rewriting a portion of the user experience like the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/1483884489235255297\">text editing engine</a>. So, where am I going with this?</p>\n<p>It is tempting to think: what if I came back to Notion? I still have my account, after all. Things always look better on the other side of the fence, right? The thing is the speed of evolution of Craft, while being considered at a fast pace by some, I‚Äôm realistic, and I would argue the contrary. The team behind Craft is surely a fraction of Notion‚Äôs. Basic things are hard to come by. Said another way, my expectations aren‚Äôt met as fast as I wished. Take this week‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/whats-new\">update,</a> which was released earlier this week. While I‚Äôm happy to see improvements, there is not much to talk about. The release notes starts by the possibility to ‚Äústar‚Äù a document, so it is easier to find in the navigation bar on the left. The second thing on the list is some improvements to the display of backlinks at the end of a page. While being welcomed by many, it‚Äôs not exactly mind-blowing. Sure it is a dot dot release (v2.0.3), but I was expecting so much more, as documented in my <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/dxwb0SsrGtPF47\">Craft wish list</a>.

				"content_text": "![](https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/ef2aba2dde.png \"Craft main window\")\n\nAs you probably know, I‚Äôm a big fan of [Craft](https://www.craft.do). This application is really at the center of everything I do online, as thoroughly documented in [my blogger workflow](https://numericcitizen.io/2021/12/18/my-blogger-workflow-as-of-2021-12). That being said, I always keep an eye open for competing services, thanks to my Twitter list ‚Äú[Apps & Services](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1346445507560960003)‚Äù. Notion is one of them. Before Craft, there was Notion, which I loved too. But it felt too complicated or overkill for my needs. Craft is nowhere near Notion in terms of features. There is no comparison, even though [I wrote one](https://numericcitizen.me/2021/03/12/craft-vs-notion-from-a-bloggers-perspective/). Really. Yet, according to [their recent tweets](https://twitter.com/NotionHQ), Notion has been on a roll lately, adding features, tweaking things or rewriting a portion of the user experience like the [text editing engine](https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/1483884489235255297). So, where am I going with this?\n\nIt is tempting to think: what if I came back to Notion? I still have my account, after all. Things always look better on the other side of the fence, right? The thing is the speed of evolution of Craft, while being considered at a fast pace by some, I‚Äôm realistic, and I would argue the contrary. The team behind Craft is surely a fraction of Notion‚Äôs. Basic things are hard to come by. Said another way, my expectations aren‚Äôt met as fast as I wished. Take this week‚Äôs [update,](https://www.craft.do/whats-new) which was released earlier this week. While I‚Äôm happy to see improvements, there is not much to talk about. The release notes starts by the possibility to ‚Äústar‚Äù a document, so it is easier to find in the navigation bar on the left. The second thing on the list is some improvements to the display of backlinks at the end of a page. While being welcomed by many, it‚Äôs not exactly mind-blowing. Sure it is a dot dot release (v2.0.3), but I was expecting so much more, as documented in my [Craft wish list](https://www.craft.do/s/dxwb0SsrGtPF47). Craft eXtensions, announced with the 2.0 release at the end of 2021 sure looks full of potential, but my expectations lean toward Craft‚Äôs core experience, which I find somewhat lacking. \n\nI think I‚Äôm being overly demanding. Patience is a virtue. \n\n",

I‚Äôve been using Unsplash constantly to find and use pictures in many of my posts (when I cannot find one of mines that fit the post subject). My contributions slowed a bit in the last year because I spend more time building my online presence on Smugmug ([my Smugmug page](https://numericcitizen.smugmug.com)) and more recently on Glass ([my profile on Glass](https://glass.photo/numericcitizen)). \n\nThis week, the picture above has been selected to be featured in the architecture category. I‚Äôm honoured. You can see [my featured photo in the architecture category](https://unsplash.com/t/architecture) right now. The last time that I‚Äôve been _unsplashed_ was less than a year ago, I wrote about it on my main blog: [OMG ‚Äî I‚Äôve Been Unsplashed!](https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/30/ive-been-unsplashed/ \"OMG ‚Äî I‚Äôve Been Unsplashed!\").\n\nTo see all of my contributions to Unsplash, visit [my profile page](https://unsplash.com/@numericcitizen).

Using FaceTime, up to 32 people can share and annotate a PDF. According to the [documented workflow](https://www.macobserver.com/news/pdf-expert-shareplay/) on The MacObserver website, while in a FaceTime call, opening a PDF file with PDF Expert enables the SharePlay feature.\n\nI tried the SharePlay experience using Music and screen sharing to see how easy the SharePlay workflow is to master. Each of my test with Apple Music ended up with a popup saying the selected content couldn‚Äôt be shared (probably controlled by the owner of the music track-not surprising at all). With screen sharing, I had more success and the feature worked as expected. \n\nI think this is all cool and SharePlay brings Apple‚Äôs ecosystem closer to what is possible within Zoom or Teams. \n\nWhat I‚Äôd like to see is more application support for SharePlay. Apple‚Äôs Keynote would be another winner where people could watch the same presentation together. I find it surprising that‚Äôs not already the case. Maybe an upcoming update to iWork will fix that.\n\nl‚Äôll definitively play with this more in the coming days because I think SharePlay has a lot o potential, especially in the business space. \n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>So, I took the plunge and installed <strong>iPadOS 15 beta2</strong> on my iPad Pro. A few observations. It‚Äôs beta and it shows. Home screen and widgets placement is janky. One springboard crash so far. All my apps are working just fine. <strong>Battery life</strong> is taking a hit. <strong>Text recognition</strong> in pictures is jaw breaking and open up all sort of new use cases. The <strong>QuickNote</strong> feature is a nice addition that will complement my blogger workflow. QuickNotes appear as regular notes on iOS 14. The <strong>loupe</strong> is back, thanks god, but I think refinements are needed: it is hard to distinguish from the surrounding text. I completely redone my home screen arrangment. I didn‚Äôt setup <strong>Focus modes</strong> yet as I‚Äôm not done with home screens setup yet, both are tied together. I love the new notifications design. I‚Äôm really liking iPadOS 15 so far.

One springboard crash so far. All my apps are working just fine. **Battery life** is taking a hit. **Text recognition** in pictures is jaw breaking and open up all sort of new use cases. The **QuickNote** feature is a nice addition that will complement my blogger workflow. QuickNotes appear as regular notes on iOS 14. The **loupe** is back, thanks god, but I think refinements are needed: it is hard to distinguish from the surrounding text. I completely redone my home screen arrangment.

Thanks to Matt [blog post](https://birchtree.me/blog/payment-processing-is-not-a-commodity/), I have a better view of what goes behind the scene here. \n\nThat being said, Apple‚Äôs payment processing service within the App Store serves Apple's purposes and is the one that is very narrow, very focused.

Apple&rsquo;s Mac machines have featured Thunderbolt technology for years now, but current ‚ÄåiPad Pro‚Äå and iPad Air models have standard USB-C ports.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such an iPad feature has to come with much improved operating system support for external devices, like external monitors, which is currently very limited under iPadOS 14.4.

Jason Fried explaining why he never had a blog:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was primarily because setting up a personal blog was just too much of a hassle. It felt formal, it required yet another tool, yet another place to write, yet another platform to pay for just one feature. I had to pick a template, I had to think up a name, I had to make the relationship official.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, setting up a blog can be a hassle. For me, it is some kind of challenge and an exercise in creativity. <strong><em>This brings me to something I want to share with you.</em></strong> I‚Äôve been working on something new in the last few days. I‚Äôm very excited about it. I started a ‚Äú<strong><em>metablog</em></strong>‚Äù. Yes, another place to publish content. What is it? Well, it is a blog about blogging.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs see what Wikipedia has to say about the word ‚Äú<strong><em>meta</em></strong>‚Äù:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any subject can be said to have a metatheory, a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its foundations, methods, form and utility, on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a metalanguage, language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why do I feel the need to create yet another numeric space? Well, I believe in focused channels in general. I wanted a dedicated space for writing about being a blogger, using tools and services to put things together and out to the world. In other words, it is more about the ‚Äúhow‚Äù than anything else. I believe people like to get a look behind the curtain. I certainly do. So, I created this space where I‚Äôll post my updates to <a href=\"https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/30/my-updated-blogger-workflow-as-of-2021-01/\">my blogger workflow</a>, in more detail.</p>\n<p>So, there you have it: <strong><a href=\"https://numericcitizen.io\">Numeric Citizen I/O</a></strong>.

I had to pick a template, I had to think up a name, I had to make the relationship official.‚Äù\n> \n\nSure, setting up a blog can be a hassle. For me, it is some kind of challenge and an exercise in creativity. **_This brings me to something I want to share with you._** I‚Äôve been working on something new in the last few days. I‚Äôm very excited about it. I started a ‚Äú**_metablog_**‚Äù. Yes, another place to publish content. What is it? Well, it is a blog about blogging. \n\nLet‚Äôs see what Wikipedia has to say about the word ‚Äú**_meta_**‚Äù:\n\n> Any subject can be said to have a metatheory, a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its foundations, methods, form and utility, on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a metalanguage, language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).\n> \n\nWhy do I feel the need to create yet another numeric space? Well, I believe in focused channels in general. I wanted a dedicated space for writing about being a blogger, using tools and services to put things together and out to the world. In other words, it is more about the ‚Äúhow‚Äù than anything else. I believe people like to get a look behind the curtain. I certainly do. So, I created this space where I‚Äôll post my updates to [my blogger workflow](https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/30/my-updated-blogger-workflow-as-of-2021-01/), in more detail. \n\nSo, there you have it: **[Numeric Citizen I/O](https://numericcitizen.io)**. You‚Äôll be able to comment on each individual post (I‚Äôm using Commento, a privacy-friendly commenting service.). I dearly encourage you to engage in discussion, ask questions or leave your comments. Thanks for visiting! \n\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/37dd52a8f6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It all started with the idea of tweaking my <strong>micro.blog</strong> visual theme. I don‚Äôt like it, but this is the best that I could find from the included themes. After reading for a while and seeing people writing about their blogger workflow, I found out that Micro.blog is using <strong>Hugo</strong>, a static website generator. Then I started to learn about Hugo by searching for introduction videos on YouTube. Then, I learned about Hugo themes and how they are constructed, and at the center of how a website is displayed. Since static websites need a place to be stored, <strong>GIT</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> came into the picture. So, I started to read about GIT and Github. Git and Hugo both can be installed on my Mac mini to locally create content and generate a microblog from that. It a great experimentation place to learn and dig a bit deeper. Github is also a place to find new Hugo-based visual <strong>themes</strong>. Then I learned that I can import one of those themes on my machine so can change the visual appearance of my local Hugo microblog. Then, came the idea of publishing this content on the web, on Github, for free. To close the loop, services are available to take Github content and generate a <strong>static website</strong>, again using Hugo, behind a domain name of my choice.

				"content_text": "![](https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/37dd52a8f6.jpg)\n\nIt all started with the idea of tweaking my **micro.blog** visual theme. I don‚Äôt like it, but this is the best that I could find from the included themes. After reading for a while and seeing people writing about their blogger workflow, I found out that Micro.blog is using **Hugo**, a static website generator. Then I started to learn about Hugo by searching for introduction videos on YouTube. Then, I learned about Hugo themes and how they are constructed, and at the center of how a website is displayed. Since static websites need a place to be stored, **GIT** and **Github** came into the picture. So, I started to read about GIT and Github. Git and Hugo both can be installed on my Mac mini to locally create content and generate a microblog from that. It a great experimentation place to learn and dig a bit deeper. Github is also a place to find new Hugo-based visual **themes**. Then I learned that I can import one of those themes on my machine so can change the visual appearance of my local Hugo microblog. Then, came the idea of publishing this content on the web, on Github, for free. To close the loop, services are available to take Github content and generate a **static website**, again using Hugo, behind a domain name of my choice. Then came the question: why do I need Microblog then? I could own the whole widget! It‚Äôs not that simple. \n\nAll this because I‚Äôm not satisfied with my current Micro.blog visual appearance.

In a word: wow! I wanted to see the latest movie from Pixal: Soul. I decided to try Disney+ for the occasion. It's the best streaming experience I ever had. From the mandatory signup process to browsing content and watching movies, I'm sold. Rightfully, Apple named the Disney+ Apple TV app the best of 2020. Not only Disney knows how to create great movies, they also know how to create great user experience for the Apple TV. Apple should take some notes here.

It&rsquo;s is about Apple Silicon wizardry. For techy people only!</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;In case you were wondering: Apple&rsquo;s replacement for Intel processors turns out to work really, really well. Some otherwise skeptical techies are calling it &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It runs Intel code extraordinarily well. The basic reason is that Arm and Intel architectures have converged. Yes, the instruction sets are different, but the underlying architectural issues have become very similar. The biggest hurdle was &ldquo;memory-ordering&rdquo;, the order in which two CPUs see modifications in memory by each other. It&rsquo;s the biggest problem affecting Microsoft&rsquo;s emulation of x86 on their Arm-based &ldquo;Surface&rdquo; laptops. So Apple simply cheated. They added Intel&rsquo;s memory-ordering to their CPU. When running translated x86 code, they switch the mode of the CPU to conform to Intel&rsquo;s memory ordering. With underlying architectural issues ironed out, running x86 code simply means translating those instructions to the Arm equivalent. This is very efficient and results in code that often runs at the same speed. Sometimes there isn&rsquo;t a direct equivalent, so the translation results in slightly slower code, but benchmarks show x86 being consistently at least 70% of the speed. In any case, a surprising number of popular apps already run on it. Apple seeded developer systems a few months back, allowing people to get their code ready. Normally, that wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough time. When you recompile code for a new architecture, it usually breaks. But as I said above: Arm and Intel architectures have converged enough that code is much less likely to break, making recompiling easier. Apple has made surprising choices. They&rsquo;ve optimized JavaScript, with special JavaScript-specific instructions, double sized L1 caches, and probably other tricks I don&rsquo;t know of. Thus, as you browse the web, their new laptop will seem faster and last longer on battery, because JavaScript, even though other benchmarks show it roughly the same speed as Intel/AMD. The older MacBook Air had a dual core CPU that ran at 3.8 GHz, but when in low-power mode, 1.2 GHz. Switching between fast and slow modes is how it conserves power for mobile. But it&rsquo;s ultimately inefficient. The Intel CPU is designed to run at 5 GHz. Downclocking to 1 GHz saves power &ndash; but not as much as if you&rsquo;d designed the processor to run at 1 GHz to begin with. Apple&rsquo;s strategy is to use two processors: one designed to run fast above 3 GHz, and the other to run slow below 2 GHz. Apple calls this their &ldquo;performance&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. Each optimized to be their best at their goal. When they need to conserve power, they turn off the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; processors and run code on their &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. They have 4x performance processors (twice that of their older Macs) plus 4x efficiency processors. All 8 can be active. When doing something that can use 8 processors, such as compiling code, it goes real REAL fast. 8 processors vs. 2 processors in their old notebooks make a difference. A big part of this story is that Intel is about 3 years behind on Moore&rsquo;s Law. Apple Silicon uses the latest 5nm tech from TMSC, while Intel uses the older 10nm/7nm generation. Much of Intel&rsquo;s product line uses the even older 14nm/10nm generation. None of this is actual &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all pretty understandable. It&rsquo;s just all the various things have been executed really well, leading to a combined result that is a great leap forward. Another &ldquo;magic&rdquo; trick is how their &ldquo;Swift&rdquo; programming language uses &ldquo;reference counting&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;garbage collection&rdquo; in Android. They did something in their CPU to double the speed of reference counting. &hellip;even when translating x86 code, all that reference counting overhead (already more efficient than garbage collection) gets dropped in half.

Every single day, I&#8217;m baffled by the lack of flexibility on iPadOS. It&#8217;s a crime or a lack of courage, you tell me ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. </p>\n\n<p>From an end-user perspective, managing widgets can be a frustrating experience. Apple can do better here. For example: in the screenshot below, users should be able to add a widget on an existing stack. Doing so on the home screen can mess your carefully designed arrangement pretty badly which will take careful manipulations to fix. Also, It&#8217;s hard to remember when there is a widgets stack instead of a single widget just looking at the home screen. On the iPad, scroll down the widgets will often trigger scrolling within the widgets stack instead which is frustrating. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t miss the interactive version of widgets of pre-iOS 14. I have way too many home screen pages. What is the maximum, by the way? ü§î I tend to forget about the old iOS Today View. It&#8217;s the best place to Four-by-four widgets like news. In general, this is a great version 2.0 of widgets implementation. Looking forward for improved behaviors. </p>\n\n<p>I have found and adopted a few great widgets: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widgetsmith/id1523682319\">Widgetsmith</a> as a lot of potential, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumy/id908905093\">Lumy</a> is really nice, Numerico (still in beta testing phase) is really useful Google analytics app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pedometer/id712286167\">Pedometer</a> is a nice one too, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waterminder/id653031147\">WaterMinder</a> a must for me, <a href=\"http://weatherlineapp.com/\">Weather Line</a> the best design in this category, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buddywatch-watch-faces/id1526992897\">Buddywatch</a> a wonderful and useful app for watch face lovers like me, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692\">Streaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2020/23b43f8290.png\" alt=\"IMG 6484\" border=\"0\" width=\"277\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",
