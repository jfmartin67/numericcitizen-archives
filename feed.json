It was in my early days here on Micro.blog. Then came the teaser strategy era. Taking advantage of Micro.blog cross-posting feature, all my posts had to be cross-posted on Twitter and made sure to systematically add hashtags to the post's title to get attention. People on Twitter using hashtags for search could potentially hit my posts. That was total nonsense. Then, the \"titled strategy\" came in where all my posts would get a title. Readers would then need to expand my post to read the content. Lastly, the current strategy, the best IMO, is to use the title for longer posts only. Otherwise, I leave the title field empty, hoping readers will hit the link to read the rest of the post.</p>\n<p>Maybe I should have set the title for this one. 🤔</p>\n",

Let’s say you shoot a photo in RAW and then switch to Apple’s Photos app. Tapping on the thumbnail brings up the image, and after a few seconds, the image gets changed to a lower-quality version. Contrast is lost, and exposure is somewhat lowered. The result is a dull image. My possible explanation is that the thumbnail is a JPEG post-processed interpretation of the RAW image that is presented in the UI. When tapping on the thumbnail, the RAW version gets uncompressed and presented, which replaces the full-size JPEG preview version, hence the image quality degradation. </p>\n<p>Do you have a similar understanding, or do you have another explanation?</p>\n",

Here are a few things that I’m going to explore. First, as a subscriber of SoundCloud, I’m finding it hard to find content for my DJ mixing experimentation. More often than not, those publishing content on SoundCloud wants you to buy  what's available on Beatport. Someone told me recently to use Beatport instead. I may switch from SoundCloud to Beatport for 2023. Second, I’ll continue my slow migration from Smugmug to <a href=\"https://stories.numericcitizen.photos\">my Exposure page</a>. Smugmug was good but didn’t fit well with what I expected from a modern photo-sharing service. Third, I finally found a use case for recording videos with CleanShot. I’ll use it to add short video clips showing how to use specific features and tricks in Craft. Those clips will be added to <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/vgvQKijqkbyo6q\">The Craft Bible</a> (a website dedicated to Craft, the document writing app) and will come as a complement to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos\">my YouTube channel</a>.

First, I’ll be on a cruise ship for most of my twelve-day trip. Second, I don’t feel it’s secure to bring such gear to some parts of Rio or Sao Polo when we go off-board. Third, it’s tough to beat the convenience of an iPhone 13 Pro in the pocket. The Nikon bag with all my lenses feels quite heavy at times.

Makes sense.</li>\n<li>Registering with a specific instance (or server) is mandatory just like opening an account with an email provider. </li>\n<li>Using a custom domain that I own is something I should consider doing. </li>\n<li>I should probably go ahead with my custom domain name for Micro.blog before doing anything related to Mastodon. </li>\n<li>Setting my websites (I do have a few) to display my Mastodon username or profile is a good idea too. </li>\n<li>Setting my Mastodon profile to display my website is another good practice.</li>\n<li>Finding an instance I can relate to is probably the most daunting task if my research is any indication. I didn’t find any so far. </li>\n<li>I still don’t understand how a Micro.blog compatible Mastodon name is helping in any of this. </li>\n<li>Having a registered account on a Mastodon won’t do much for me. I already get everything I want on Micro.blog. People can follow me from their Mastodon instance, and I can, too, from Micro.blog. </li>\n<li>Thinking about all this on Christmas day shows that I don’t have a life!

Both are quite different leaders, but I think Steve Jobs had a much more positive impact on Pixar than Musk on Twitter. My comparison comes from the belief that Steve could be seen as a jerk or be very hard on people. Elon is certainly seen and behaves like a real jerk. His leadership image is being tarnished every single day. </p>\n",

I still prefer Apple's macOS in that respect.<img src=\"uploads/2022/fb95795c0a.png\" alt=\"Screens MacPro 2022 12 21 10 35 23 2x\" title=\"Screens-MacPro@2022-12-21@10.35.23@2x.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"1230\" height=\"928\" style=\"float:right;\" />\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"IMG_4361.jpeg\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/ae135221b2.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 4361\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After six weeks of waiting, I finally got this little LED-based display called “<a href=\"https://tidbyt.com/\">Tidbyt</a>”, a reference, I guess, to the old <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lite-Brite\">Lite-Brite</a> game which came out in 1967 (I had one when I was a child).</p>\n<p>Tidbyt is an intelligent wireless LED-based panel that displays content configured from the Tidbyt app available on a smartphone. Physically, the device feels high quality and well-designed and is framed with real wood, reminiscent of mid-century furniture.</p>\n<p>Content is configured using applets that you put together on a canvas. The display content will switch from one applet to another in the order defined on the canvas. Applets can be set to display only on a specific schedule, but the scheduling options are rather limited. It’s very simple to set this up.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Tuesday, 20 Dec 2022 06:37:07.png\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9d26fb048a.png\" alt=\"Tuesday 20 Dec 2022 06 37 07\" width=\"2000\" height=\"621\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Once the display is plugged into power via its USB-C cable, it will wait for the configuration to be done from the smartphone, a six-step process. Bluetooth is required to detect the display, and a Wifi network is required for the display to get its data from the Internet. <img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Tuesday, 20 Dec 2022 06:49:36.png\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/b1348d9ebe.png\" alt=\"Tuesday 20 Dec 2022 06 49 36\" width=\"1037\" height=\"2000\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The applets catalogue is growing but still is relatively limited. Thanks to an SDK and open APIs, developers constantly add new ones. The display is bright and can be adjusted according to a manual setting or time of the day. There is a night mode, too, if you want to put the device in one bedroom.</p>\n<p>The screen resolution seemed low at first, but from a distance, it is surprisingly good, enough to display small images.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Tidbyt makes a great addition to my home office, and people at work have already noticed it during Teams meetings and are asking questions about this little thing sitting on the shelf behind me.</p>\n",

As much as I would like to test this app, here's this deal-breaker for me: 20 US$ per month to get on the early access program, no thank you. Why?</p>\n<p>I understand Rewind is still in beta, but the developer wants me to pay for testing the application. Shouldn’t it be the other way around so I get a rebate when the app goes out of beta? I mean, even with a 30-day “trial” I still can’t get over this. If it’s 20 US$ a month now for the early access, what will be the price of the final product then? Even more expansive?</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"HEY-Your invitation to the Rewind Early Access Program!@2022-12-19@07.26.04@2x.png\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9a82125873.png\" alt=\"HEY Your invitation to the Rewind Early Access Program 2022 12 19 07 26 04 2x\" width=\"1798\" height=\"792\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Rewind makes me think of CleanShot, and I find Rewind’s pricing overly expansive if I think about the scope of both apps. </p>\n<p>Rewind is a great idea, even if it pauses many security risks, but I’ll pass for now.</p>\n",

On the Mac, once updated to Ventura 13.1, Freeform can be used to continue working on the content, albeit with a different set of tools, since there is no Apple Pencil support over there. One question is, why is the tools palette on the iPad different from the one with Apple Notes? I mean, there are pencils or crayons that I prefer on Notes over the available choices in Freemform’s palette. Following is a comparison of both. At the top is the Apple Notes tools palette. At the bottom is Apple’s Freeform. The latter seems a bit childish, too simplistic. I really wish there were more pencil types. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"IMG_8775.jpeg\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/40c91a438a.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 8775\" width=\"2778\" height=\"1082\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"IMG_8776.jpeg\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2022/392fd820df.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 8776\" width=\"2778\" height=\"1012\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Other than that, I didn’t test the collaborative work with someone else.

The official announcement follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Today we’re announcing a major new feature for Micro.blog Premium subscribers: email newsletters. Micro.blog can now manage, letting readers subscribe to your blog and receive emails for new blog posts. It’s deeply integrated into Micro.blog and works great for collecting multiple microblog posts together automatically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is why I upgraded my subscription plan almost instantly after the news came out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/4b9777e139.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>First, I’m a big fan of Micro.blog as a publishing platform and also of its foundational principles. I’m totally ok with paying a monthly fee of $10 to support the team behind—I want the platform to thrive. Second, adding support for newsletters is a great idea. Not everyone is using an RSS feed reader or like to read content through a browser. Everyone uses email clients! It’s important to provide different ways of communicating content to the readers. Newsletters are making a comeback.</p>\n<p>Enabling newsletter is dead simple as shown below. I chose the weekly newsletter containing all the posts for the past week. Email go out at 9AM, local time, each Saturday morning. It’s a good way to start the weekend, isn’t it?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/1e79d6e31e.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, the settings are quite simple. There is no formatting option (yet). Having a choice between all text vs excerpt would be a useful one. Speaking of formatting, one thing that I&rsquo;m curious about, though: how does one newsletter look like? I couldn&rsquo;t find an example in the documentation. Furthermore, how can we preview the next newsletter issue? It seems that, in case the first option is selected (one email for each post), the author has 30 minutes after posting to preview the email as explained here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://micro.blog/timapple\">@timapple</a> The preview works the same for the weekly and monthly option except it only creates it 30 minutes before it&rsquo;s ready to send. Micro.blog will send you a preview email automatically with a link to edit it then. — Manton Reece <a href=\"https://micro.blog/manton/12238527\">https://micro.blog/manton/12238527</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How does Micro.blog newsletter feature fit in my workflow? Micro.blog newsletter joins two other services that I depend on: Mailbrew to create something very similar in nature to Micro.blog offering and Ghost for my monthly newsletter (<a href=\"https://numericcitizen-introspection.blog/a-new-home-for-the-numeric-citizen-introspection-newsletter/\">previously on Substack</a>). On Mailbrew though, <a href=\"https://app.mailbrew.com/apple_observer/numeric-citizen-reading-writing-summary-newsletter-x9MmQUXjnEMG?aff=apple_observer\">my summary newsletter</a> also brings in content published on other platforms (WordPress, Blot, Ghost, Smugmug, etc.). It’s the ultimate weekly posts summary newsletter. Ghost, for <a href=\"https://numericcitizen-introspection.blog\">my introspection newsletter</a>, is like Substack, but better. I see Micro.blog offering as being a convenient way for my readers to get my content into their mailbox. It won’t replace Mailbrew or Ghost, obviously.</p>\n<p>By subscribing to the premium tier, I also get a few goodies that could prove to be useful: bookmarking archiving and highlighting. The former allows for the bookmarking of a post on my timeline. The latter allows me to highlight some text while reading a bookmarked post or URL. Highlighted text can be conveniently used to create a link post easily. One thing that I would love to see is a browser extension for selecting text in any website. I’m not holding my breath, though.</p>\n<p>All in all, I’m pretty happy with this addition to an already great service for content creators like me. Oh, and don’t forget to <a href=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/subscribe/\">subscribe</a> to the weekly digest! So, to those who subscribe, I guess this post is the first to get through the newsletter feature of Micro.blog!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/0d875fad86.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Don’t miss <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctlYRV6NnD4\">the YouTube video explaining the feature</a>.</p>\n",

This is something Apple will never enable itself, certainly not within Safari. The future looks interesting. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2021/aef3403084.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n",

With iPads, it’s the software holding the platform back. This hardware is indisputably amazing, and iPadOS is fine for casual use. But it still feels like I’m trying to do fine detail work while wearing oven mitts for my day-to-day work.\n\nI like Gruber’s introduction in his review of the M1 iPad Pro. But his review echos other reviews. Nearly all M1 iPad Pro reviews that I have read note the same issue: iPadOS lacks maturity to sustain iPad Pro aspirations. Can’t wait for Apple’s WWDC in three weeks.\n\n",

It’s a must-listen. Here are a few observations and remarks.\n\n1. I love Tim Cook’s stance on issues like privacy protection. But at the same time, I have a hard time understanding how Apple can continue to [sign a search deal with Google](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/aapl-raised-services-revenue-forecast) while advocating privacy protection.

Today, Apple under Tim Cook, has never been so well positioned to represent the best corporate defender of many of my core values: **privacy protection**, careful **attention to details** in design, openness to **diversity**, **environment** protection, sustainable development, **great user experiences**. Apple is not perfect, far from it. Yet, there is nothing like them these days. \n3. Tim Cook is candidly answering the question of where he sees himself in ten years from now. I wonder what are the plans for his or her successor? Does he and Apple’s upper management actively put as much thought into it as Steve Jobs did in his last few years at Apple? I wonder and I hope this is the case.\n4. This interview maybe [seen as a bit self-serving](https://www.ped30.com/2021/04/05/apple-cook-swisher-sway/), yet it is what it is.

So, I learned about DJ mixer, controllers, DJ software, music sources, digital record pools, file formats, MIDI, etc. Then, yesterday, unexpectedly, while visiting a music instruments store to see these equipments in person, I bought a Pioneer DDJ-400, a pair of small speakers, went home, enabled a trial of <a href=\"https://www.algoriddim.com/apps\">Djay Pro AI</a> on my iPad Pro and started to plug all the pieces together.

The world needs more of that, and there is _competitive fun_ going on with Apple and the Mac ecosystem” — Gelsinger\n\nI don’t know if this competitive landscape is fun like Gelsinger is mentioning, maybe we could ask Tim Cook?\n\n",

But here another issue: inserting images with a Markdown file is not as easy as it seems. Again, trying to figure out instructions on Blot.im site doesn’t work.

I don’t like it, but this is the best that I could find from the included themes. After reading for a while and seeing people writing about their blogger workflow, I found out that Micro.blog is using <strong>Hugo</strong>, a static website generator. Then I started to learn about Hugo by searching for introduction videos on YouTube. Then, I learned about Hugo themes and how they are constructed, and at the center of how a website is displayed. Since static websites need a place to be stored, <strong>GIT</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> came into the picture. So, I started to read about GIT and Github. Git and Hugo both can be installed on my Mac mini to locally create content and generate a microblog from that. It a great experimentation place to learn and dig a bit deeper. Github is also a place to find new Hugo-based visual <strong>themes</strong>. Then I learned that I can import one of those themes on my machine so can change the visual appearance of my local Hugo microblog. Then, came the idea of publishing this content on the web, on Github, for free. To close the loop, services are available to take Github content and generate a <strong>static website</strong>, again using Hugo, behind a domain name of my choice. Then came the question: why do I need Microblog then? I could own the whole widget! It’s not that simple.</p>\n<p>All this because I’m not satisfied with my current Micro.blog visual appearance.

This is Apple at it’s best. \n\n",

To the point new bloggers don't even know what RSS is, some recent blogging platforms don't support RSS, and the blogs of new startups sometimes don't provide RSS feeds.</blockquote>\n\nIt's a shame in a world where open standards are on the way out. RSS feeds are another important part of Podcasts, another open standard where big tech would like to monetize, i.e. make it proprietary. \n\nAmoroso continues: <blockquote>The readers who subscribe to your RSS feed always see all of your posts. No matter what Google, Facebook, or Twitter decide.</blockquote>\n\nA long time ago I decided my blogs feeds would push the complete content of the articles. As I don't have ads on my blogs, I don't really care if the readers consume the content from the RSS feed only. RSS feeds are conduits who escape any algorithm-based feeds. It's the most direct connexion between a blogger and their readers. \n\nFor the best part, Amaroso nails it: <blockquote>They are the readers you want. The superfans who share your work. They may be bloggers themselves and link to your posts from theirs, or enable other opportunities such as guest blogging or podcast interviews. Those few RSS subscribers are much more engaged and valuable than the many who don't even click links on social media.</blockquote>\n\nIf you know how to use RSS, you're my best friend, you are more then welcome.\n\nYou can find my main blog feed <a href=\"https://numericcitizen.wordpress.com/feed/\">here</a>. For my micro blog, the feed is <a href=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/feed\">here</a>. Hope you enjoy. \n\n\n",

It featured 1.2 million transistors, over four times as many as its predecessor. This processor increased the L1 cache size by a factor of eight to 4096 bytes, and it was the first 68k processor to have an on-board floating-point unit (FPU). While not without its drawbacks, the '040 processor was an obvious candidate for Apple's next line of premium workstations at the time.

Besides supporting basic things like URL, images and notes, you can group To Do lists in folders, lists can be shared with others, Shortcuts are supported, it synchronizes seamlessly across my devices. \n\nApple’s Reminders is one of the app at the center of [my blogger workflow](https://numericcitizen.me/2020/11/28/my-updated-blogger-workflow-as-of-2020-11/) to help me process  information and publish content online.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/c8675dee2d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"435\" alt=\"\" />\n",

It&rsquo;s is about Apple Silicon wizardry. For techy people only!</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;In case you were wondering: Apple&rsquo;s replacement for Intel processors turns out to work really, really well. Some otherwise skeptical techies are calling it &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It runs Intel code extraordinarily well. The basic reason is that Arm and Intel architectures have converged. Yes, the instruction sets are different, but the underlying architectural issues have become very similar. The biggest hurdle was &ldquo;memory-ordering&rdquo;, the order in which two CPUs see modifications in memory by each other. It&rsquo;s the biggest problem affecting Microsoft&rsquo;s emulation of x86 on their Arm-based &ldquo;Surface&rdquo; laptops. So Apple simply cheated. They added Intel&rsquo;s memory-ordering to their CPU. When running translated x86 code, they switch the mode of the CPU to conform to Intel&rsquo;s memory ordering. With underlying architectural issues ironed out, running x86 code simply means translating those instructions to the Arm equivalent. This is very efficient and results in code that often runs at the same speed. Sometimes there isn&rsquo;t a direct equivalent, so the translation results in slightly slower code, but benchmarks show x86 being consistently at least 70% of the speed. In any case, a surprising number of popular apps already run on it. Apple seeded developer systems a few months back, allowing people to get their code ready. Normally, that wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough time. When you recompile code for a new architecture, it usually breaks. But as I said above: Arm and Intel architectures have converged enough that code is much less likely to break, making recompiling easier. Apple has made surprising choices. They&rsquo;ve optimized JavaScript, with special JavaScript-specific instructions, double sized L1 caches, and probably other tricks I don&rsquo;t know of. Thus, as you browse the web, their new laptop will seem faster and last longer on battery, because JavaScript, even though other benchmarks show it roughly the same speed as Intel/AMD. The older MacBook Air had a dual core CPU that ran at 3.8 GHz, but when in low-power mode, 1.2 GHz. Switching between fast and slow modes is how it conserves power for mobile. But it&rsquo;s ultimately inefficient. The Intel CPU is designed to run at 5 GHz. Downclocking to 1 GHz saves power &ndash; but not as much as if you&rsquo;d designed the processor to run at 1 GHz to begin with. Apple&rsquo;s strategy is to use two processors: one designed to run fast above 3 GHz, and the other to run slow below 2 GHz. Apple calls this their &ldquo;performance&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. Each optimized to be their best at their goal. When they need to conserve power, they turn off the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; processors and run code on their &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. They have 4x performance processors (twice that of their older Macs) plus 4x efficiency processors. All 8 can be active. When doing something that can use 8 processors, such as compiling code, it goes real REAL fast. 8 processors vs. 2 processors in their old notebooks make a difference. A big part of this story is that Intel is about 3 years behind on Moore&rsquo;s Law. Apple Silicon uses the latest 5nm tech from TMSC, while Intel uses the older 10nm/7nm generation. Much of Intel&rsquo;s product line uses the even older 14nm/10nm generation. None of this is actual &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all pretty understandable. It&rsquo;s just all the various things have been executed really well, leading to a combined result that is a great leap forward. Another &ldquo;magic&rdquo; trick is how their &ldquo;Swift&rdquo; programming language uses &ldquo;reference counting&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;garbage collection&rdquo; in Android. They did something in their CPU to double the speed of reference counting. &hellip;even when translating x86 code, all that reference counting overhead (already more efficient than garbage collection) gets dropped in half.

Personally, I do subscribe to Hey and reading newsletters with their client is really nice and provides a nice clipping feature which is very handy.\n\n_**Do you not miss things like link posts and “going viral” which are much harder, if impossible to do with emails?**_\n\nLink posts can be done in newsletters and they won’t go viral for sure. But, I’m not really looking for this kind of fame to be honest. \n\n_**Is it easier to get people to sign up for a paid subscription compared to the web?**_\n\nI’m still building this stuff and my newsletter is free for now. I get new subscribers regularly but not as much as I would like. I guess I still have to get the word out and be more “famous”.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/a63b00ff31.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n",

As pointed out by Matt Birchler in [his commentary post](https://birchtree.me/blog/4-reasons-apple-may-not-allow-third-party-watch-faces/) to Tidbits article: \n\n“_CarPlay is a great example of how Apple could do this right with watch faces: only allow a certain number of companies to make custom watch faces. have them sign additional agreements and have them go through tougher reviews. Maybe there are literally 10 companies who are able to make watch faces. Maybe Apple can reject a watch face simply because they don’t like how it looks._”\n\nMy guess is that Apple will look to add more watch faces through collaborative work, just like they did in watchOS 7 with the Artist watch face. \n\nPhoto by Daniel Korpai — Unsplasg\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/652c4144f8.jpg\" width=\"599\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n",

Every single day, I&#8217;m baffled by the lack of flexibility on iPadOS. It&#8217;s a crime or a lack of courage, you tell me 🤦🏻‍♂️. </p>\n\n<p>From an end-user perspective, managing widgets can be a frustrating experience. Apple can do better here. For example: in the screenshot below, users should be able to add a widget on an existing stack. Doing so on the home screen can mess your carefully designed arrangement pretty badly which will take careful manipulations to fix. Also, It&#8217;s hard to remember when there is a widgets stack instead of a single widget just looking at the home screen. On the iPad, scroll down the widgets will often trigger scrolling within the widgets stack instead which is frustrating. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t miss the interactive version of widgets of pre-iOS 14. I have way too many home screen pages. What is the maximum, by the way? 🤔 I tend to forget about the old iOS Today View. It&#8217;s the best place to Four-by-four widgets like news. In general, this is a great version 2.0 of widgets implementation. Looking forward for improved behaviors. </p>\n\n<p>I have found and adopted a few great widgets: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/widgetsmith/id1523682319\">Widgetsmith</a> as a lot of potential, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lumy/id908905093\">Lumy</a> is really nice, Numerico (still in beta testing phase) is really useful Google analytics app, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pedometer/id712286167\">Pedometer</a> is a nice one too, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waterminder/id653031147\">WaterMinder</a> a must for me, <a href=\"http://weatherlineapp.com/\">Weather Line</a> the best design in this category, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buddywatch-watch-faces/id1526992897\">Buddywatch</a> a wonderful and useful app for watch face lovers like me, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692\">Streaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2020/23b43f8290.png\" alt=\"IMG 6484\" border=\"0\" width=\"277\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",

For me, it doesn’t represent an issue. I love to buy into this philosophy because it is different, delightful. His tweet, one is a series is interesting. But, one the following ones, things get just wrong:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Propping iPad up at a *good* angle? Pay $350 for a cover that prevents you from using it like a book anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don’t get it. Remove the iPad from its keyboard and voilà! Simple. And this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the iPad is now a worse tablet with the Magic Keyboard. It kind of sucks for typing in bed compared to the software keyboard, and it’s unusable for reading since it doesn’t flip around like a true cover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What? Can someone explain him that he can remove the iPad from the keyboard when he goes to bed at night? This thread just feel “trolly\". The iPad is obviously not for him but he doesn’t know it yet. </p>\n",

And the first thing that came to my mind was a Watch Face Construction kit. Something along the lines of a very old game, during the early days of personal computers, called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_Construction_Set\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pinball Construction Set</a>. I would imagine the process would happen within the Apple Watch app on the iPhone and installing the watch face wouldn't require a new app, just some kind of formating information bundled together and pushed to the watch. Even more interesting, Apple could create a new iPad app, a simulator, where people wold have ample space to imagine, create and publish their own personal work on their own watch.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_108\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-108\" src=\"https://blog.numericcitizen.me/uploads/2023/a84d241ca6.jpg\" alt=\"nomos2-face\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1779\" /> From David Smith blog post[/caption]\n\nBut Apple is Apple, I can't imagine this to become a reality for a while.

Leaner than WordPress. Yet capable. Close to Twitter but with less clutter. I'm on a 10 days trial period. Tested the web posting interface. Tested the native macOS (light) client. Tested the iPad version too. Now, testing cross-posting from WordPress via an IFTTT applet. I'm loving it so far. Stay tuned for more discoveries about Micro.blog.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",
