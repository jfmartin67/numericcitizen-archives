They saw the uniqueness of Weather Line and the strong foundation we’ve built. While we aren’t able to provide further details on their future plans for the app, we hope you can understand, and will look forward to it.\n\nI’m kind of in shock right now. I recently [posted an article about my “go-to” weather applications](https://numericcitizen.me/2021/02/03/great-weather-apps-for-weather-enthusiasts/). **Weather Line** wasn’t part of the line up, but I did have it installed on my iPhone, and I’m currently a paying subscriber. Too bad to see the application go. But, why? The same happened to Spend Stack [recently](https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/2021/02/14/bye-bye-spend.html). \n\nWhat’s going on? How many developers invoked paid subscription model as being the only road to sustainability? Does it work or not? Is this the start of a new trend? There is something going on here. \n\nWhen, as users, invest money and time in using applications or service, the last thing we want is to see our beloved apps go like this.

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/b7656f641a.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>How many websites a blogger can have? Good question. I do have (too?) <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/numericcitizen\">many</a>, each filling their own niche. On that subject, something caught my attention yesterday in the public announcement of <strong>HEY’s experiment</strong>: “<a href=\"https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e\">Hello, World!</a>”. Jason Fried explaining why he never had a blog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It was primarily because setting up a personal blog was just too much of a hassle. It felt formal, it required yet another tool, yet another place to write, yet another platform to pay for just one feature. I had to pick a template, I had to think up a name, I had to make the relationship official.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, setting up a blog can be a hassle. For me, it is some kind of challenge and an exercise in creativity. <strong><em>This brings me to something I want to share with you.</em></strong> I’ve been working on something new in the last few days. I’m very excited about it. I started a “<strong><em>metablog</em></strong>”. Yes, another place to publish content. What is it? Well, it is a blog about blogging.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s see what Wikipedia has to say about the word “<strong><em>meta</em></strong>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any subject can be said to have a metatheory, a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its foundations, methods, form and utility, on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a metalanguage, language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why do I feel the need to create yet another numeric space? Well, I believe in focused channels in general. I wanted a dedicated space for writing about being a blogger, using tools and services to put things together and out to the world.

				"content_text": "![](https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/b7656f641a.jpg)\n\nHow many websites a blogger can have? Good question. I do have (too?) [many](https://linktr.ee/numericcitizen), each filling their own niche. On that subject, something caught my attention yesterday in the public announcement of **HEY’s experiment**: “[Hello, World!](https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e)”. Jason Fried explaining why he never had a blog:\n\n> “It was primarily because setting up a personal blog was just too much of a hassle. It felt formal, it required yet another tool, yet another place to write, yet another platform to pay for just one feature. I had to pick a template, I had to think up a name, I had to make the relationship official.”\n> \n\nSure, setting up a blog can be a hassle. For me, it is some kind of challenge and an exercise in creativity. **_This brings me to something I want to share with you._** I’ve been working on something new in the last few days. I’m very excited about it. I started a “**_metablog_**”. Yes, another place to publish content. What is it? Well, it is a blog about blogging. \n\nLet’s see what Wikipedia has to say about the word “**_meta_**”:\n\n> Any subject can be said to have a metatheory, a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its foundations, methods, form and utility, on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a metalanguage, language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).\n> \n\nWhy do I feel the need to create yet another numeric space? Well, I believe in focused channels in general. I wanted a dedicated space for writing about being a blogger, using tools and services to put things together and out to the world. In other words, it is more about the “how” than anything else. I believe people like to get a look behind the curtain. I certainly do. So, I created this space where I’ll post my updates to [my blogger workflow](https://numericcitizen.me/2021/01/30/my-updated-blogger-workflow-as-of-2021-01/), in more detail. \n\nSo, there you have it: **[Numeric Citizen I/O](https://numericcitizen.io)**.

Tried to follow the Blot.im <a href=\"https://blot.im/how/configure/domain\">instructions</a> to make it work but all attempts failed.

After cloning the Git repo from Blot.im to my local machine, I can then use Ulysses to write my posts and push them with Nova. The workflow is very geeky: create .MD file in Ulysses, “commit” within Nova then hit “push” to publish. Not as seamless as I would like. But here another issue: inserting images with a Markdown file is not as easy as it seems. Again, trying to figure out instructions on Blot.im site doesn’t work.

Then I started to learn about Hugo by searching for introduction videos on YouTube. Then, I learned about Hugo themes and how they are constructed, and at the center of how a website is displayed. Since static websites need a place to be stored, <strong>GIT</strong> and <strong>Github</strong> came into the picture. So, I started to read about GIT and Github. Git and Hugo both can be installed on my Mac mini to locally create content and generate a microblog from that. It a great experimentation place to learn and dig a bit deeper. Github is also a place to find new Hugo-based visual <strong>themes</strong>. Then I learned that I can import one of those themes on my machine so can change the visual appearance of my local Hugo microblog. Then, came the idea of publishing this content on the web, on Github, for free. To close the loop, services are available to take Github content and generate a <strong>static website</strong>, again using Hugo, behind a domain name of my choice. Then came the question: why do I need Microblog then? I could own the whole widget! It’s not that simple.</p>\n\n<p>All this because I’m not satisfied with my current Micro.blog visual appearance.

I do understand that this is entering a dangerous territory of « algorithm fed reality ». I guess it is har to strike a balance in that respect. Finally, the categories are lacking a bit of breath. Where is “Tech” or “Privacy” or “Climate”?\n\nSo, I’m waiting for your referrals. Thanks for taking some of your time to do so. 🙂\n\n",

We want them to Fix It, but we don&rsquo;t actually know what that means.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I often think about issues that platforms like Facebook brings to our society. I don’t pretend to have any solution. I can’t quite define what Facebook is actually from a societal point of view. That being said, a lack of definition and understanding cannot prevent me to wish for things to be done differently. And I have one simple wish.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>I want the eradication of algorithm-based feeds</em></strong>. I want them to be regulated, prohibited even. At the very least, it should be an opt-in “feature”. I want the return of chronological feeds. No tweaks, no tricks, nothing more. Nothing less. I want all people to have a look at the same reality.

				"content_text": "![](https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2021/bbfa7eeeaa.jpg)\n\nA [recent article](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/1/17/speech-and-publishing) by Benedict Evans exposes how hard it is to “fix” social networks.\n\n> “The internet and then social platforms break a lot of our definitions of different kinds of speech, and yet somehow Facebook / Google / Twitter are supposed to recreate that whole 200-year tapestry of implicit structures and consensus, and answer all of those questions, from office parks in the San Francisco Bay Area, for both the USA and Myanmar, right now. We want them to Fix It, but we don't actually know what that means.”\n> \n\nI often think about issues that platforms like Facebook brings to our society. I don’t pretend to have any solution. I can’t quite define what Facebook is actually from a societal point of view. That being said, a lack of definition and understanding cannot prevent me to wish for things to be done differently. And I have one simple wish. \n\n**_I want the eradication of algorithm-based feeds_**. I want them to be regulated, prohibited even. At the very least, it should be an opt-in “feature”. I want the return of chronological feeds. No tweaks, no tricks, nothing more. Nothing less. I want all people to have a look at the same reality. Two people having the exact same followers and following the same guys should give the same timeline. Period. \n\nWithout hyper-manipulated feeds, we have to wonder about the usefulness of all gathered data about us and our behaviours. Maybe ads targeting doesn’t make as much sense in tact hypothetical context. \n\nIf two people don’t see the same thing, it’s because the choice was made by an individual wishing to control his or her exposure, not by a corporation’s algorithm or an arbitrary group of people.\n\nThat’s my wish.

Here comes the new visual search feature. Here is another one that could be a game-changer. Suppose you happen to find a picture online that is tied by a very restrictive license.

After spending a few minutes glancing at the different type of workouts, I elected to do a twenty minutes treadmill workout using my iPhone and my AirPods Pro. For this session, Jamie-Ray was my coach. As you can see, I think I made pretty well. I liked everything about the experience, from onboarding to the actual workout session with on-screen feedbacks and the finale. The music choice was good too! After my session, I gave a look at the Apple TV Fitness application. Upon launching the app, you have to select the Apple Watch associated with the person who will interact with the service. One note, if your Apple Watch name is too long, spacing on the screen won’t allow you to easily see which Apple Watch is which; you’ll have to wait so see the text to scroll, it’s a bit of an annoyance. I checked a few workout previews and sure enough, the video quality is exceptional on the Apple TV 4K.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, this is a great start for Fitness+.

				"content_html": "<p>Here is a super fascinating Twitter thread that I reproduce here. Find the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erratarob/status/1331735383193903104?s=21\">original tweets here</a>. It&rsquo;s is about Apple Silicon wizardry. For techy people only!</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;In case you were wondering: Apple&rsquo;s replacement for Intel processors turns out to work really, really well. Some otherwise skeptical techies are calling it &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It runs Intel code extraordinarily well. The basic reason is that Arm and Intel architectures have converged. Yes, the instruction sets are different, but the underlying architectural issues have become very similar. The biggest hurdle was &ldquo;memory-ordering&rdquo;, the order in which two CPUs see modifications in memory by each other. It&rsquo;s the biggest problem affecting Microsoft&rsquo;s emulation of x86 on their Arm-based &ldquo;Surface&rdquo; laptops. So Apple simply cheated. They added Intel&rsquo;s memory-ordering to their CPU. When running translated x86 code, they switch the mode of the CPU to conform to Intel&rsquo;s memory ordering. With underlying architectural issues ironed out, running x86 code simply means translating those instructions to the Arm equivalent. This is very efficient and results in code that often runs at the same speed.

Thus, as you browse the web, their new laptop will seem faster and last longer on battery, because JavaScript, even though other benchmarks show it roughly the same speed as Intel/AMD. The older MacBook Air had a dual core CPU that ran at 3.8 GHz, but when in low-power mode, 1.2 GHz. Switching between fast and slow modes is how it conserves power for mobile. But it&rsquo;s ultimately inefficient. The Intel CPU is designed to run at 5 GHz. Downclocking to 1 GHz saves power &ndash; but not as much as if you&rsquo;d designed the processor to run at 1 GHz to begin with. Apple&rsquo;s strategy is to use two processors: one designed to run fast above 3 GHz, and the other to run slow below 2 GHz. Apple calls this their &ldquo;performance&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. Each optimized to be their best at their goal. When they need to conserve power, they turn off the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; processors and run code on their &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; processors. They have 4x performance processors (twice that of their older Macs) plus 4x efficiency processors. All 8 can be active. When doing something that can use 8 processors, such as compiling code, it goes real REAL fast. 8 processors vs. 2 processors in their old notebooks make a difference. A big part of this story is that Intel is about 3 years behind on Moore&rsquo;s Law. Apple Silicon uses the latest 5nm tech from TMSC, while Intel uses the older 10nm/7nm generation. Much of Intel&rsquo;s product line uses the even older 14nm/10nm generation. None of this is actual &ldquo;black magic&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s all pretty understandable. It&rsquo;s just all the various things have been executed really well, leading to a combined result that is a great leap forward.

				"content_text": "Here is a super fascinating Twitter thread that I reproduce here. Find the [original tweets here](https://twitter.com/erratarob/status/1331735383193903104?s=21). It's is about Apple Silicon wizardry. For techy people only! \r\n\r\n_\"In case you were wondering: Apple's replacement for Intel processors turns out to work really, really well. Some otherwise skeptical techies are calling it \"black magic\". It runs Intel code extraordinarily well. The basic reason is that Arm and Intel architectures have converged. Yes, the instruction sets are different, but the underlying architectural issues have become very similar. The biggest hurdle was \"memory-ordering\", the order in which two CPUs see modifications in memory by each other. It's the biggest problem affecting Microsoft's emulation of x86 on their Arm-based \"Surface\" laptops. So Apple simply cheated. They added Intel's memory-ordering to their CPU. When running translated x86 code, they switch the mode of the CPU to conform to Intel's memory ordering. With underlying architectural issues ironed out, running x86 code simply means translating those instructions to the Arm equivalent. This is very efficient and results in code that often runs at the same speed. Sometimes there isn't a direct equivalent, so the translation results in slightly slower code, but benchmarks show x86 being consistently at least 70% of the speed. In any case, a surprising number of popular apps already run on it. Apple seeded developer systems a few months back, allowing people to get their code ready.

				"title": "A follow up to @mattbirchler on why opting for Newsletters instead of a blog? (#blogger #blogging #writing #substack)",
				"content_html": "<p>In a recent blog post, the well known blogger and content creator, Matt Birchler, wants to understand why so many people are opting for emails (newsletters) over the web. I want to give my perspective on each of his questions.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>What about writing in a newsletter is more enjoyable than writing for a blog?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>My <em><a href=\"https://numericcitizen.substack.com\">Numeric Citizen Introspection</a></em> newsletter is a monthly one. I start writing the next issue at the beginning of each month. I hit “Publish and send” at the very end of each month. It gives me four weeks to nurture its content. When the end of the month approaches, the newsletter content is mostly complete and I like how it evolved from the beginning. It is a satisfying process. Then, I take a pause and look forward to start the next one. I like the regular beat of all this process. I wouldn’t do a weekly newsletter, though, as it requires much more time to do.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Are newsletter audiences more engaged than blog subscribers?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure about this one in general. For me, it is too early to tell. My gut feeling is that people are more or less engaged the same way as they are with blogs. I’d like to be wrong, though, and have people engage more with newsletters.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>As a reader, do you prefer reading in your email app to an RSS app (or just the web in general)?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>I use Substack to build and send my newsletters.

				"content_text": "In a recent blog post, the well known blogger and content creator, Matt Birchler, wants to understand why so many people are opting for emails (newsletters) over the web. I want to give my perspective on each of his questions. \n\n_**What about writing in a newsletter is more enjoyable than writing for a blog?**_\n\nMy _[Numeric Citizen Introspection](https://numericcitizen.substack.com)_ newsletter is a monthly one. I start writing the next issue at the beginning of each month. I hit “Publish and send” at the very end of each month. It gives me four weeks to nurture its content. When the end of the month approaches, the newsletter content is mostly complete and I like how it evolved from the beginning. It is a satisfying process. Then, I take a pause and look forward to start the next one. I like the regular beat of all this process. I wouldn’t do a weekly newsletter, though, as it requires much more time to do. \n\n_**Are newsletter audiences more engaged than blog subscribers?**_\n\nI’m not sure about this one in general. For me, it is too early to tell. My gut feeling is that people are more or less engaged the same way as they are with blogs. I’d like to be wrong, though, and have people engage more with newsletters.\n\n_**As a reader, do you prefer reading in your email app to an RSS app (or just the web in general)?**_\n\nI use Substack to build and send my newsletters. Each of them are also available via an RSS feed. Depending of the client used, the reading experience can be enjoyable on both type of clients. Personally, I do subscribe to Hey and reading newsletters with their client is really nice and provides a nice clipping feature which is very handy.\n\n_**Do you not miss things like link posts and “going viral” which are much harder, if impossible to do with emails?**_\n\nLink posts can be done in newsletters and they won’t go viral for sure. But, I’m not really looking for this kind of fame to be honest. \n\n_**Is it easier to get people to sign up for a paid subscription compared to the web?**_\n\nI’m still building this stuff and my newsletter is free for now. I get new subscribers regularly but not as much as I would like. I guess I still have to get the word out and be more “famous”.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2020/a63b00ff31.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\" />\n",

Many of them are putting the release of the Apple Silicon Mac in October. \n\nThere is no way this is going to happen that early. macOS Big Sur is still at Beta 3. Developers are hard at work adding support for widgets and other iOS 14 stuff. I would expect iOS 14 to be released at the end of September. iOS 14.1 will come out in beta at the beginning of October in order to support the new iPhone shipping later in October. \n\nNow back to the Mac. I expect Big Sur to be released at the very end of October if not November. The actual Apple Silicon Mac will probably be announced at a different moment than the iPhone. Apple doesn't like to mixed up things in their keynote. The actual shipping date could be at the very end of the year, just in time to catch the ramp up of the A14X production rumored to be starting in Q4. \n\nIn summary: Apple Silicon Mac to be released late in 2020.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://numericcitizen.micro.blog/uploads/2020/43839c04ea.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"503\" alt=\"\" />\n",
